    Construct a Tukey/Bland-Altman Mean Difference Plot.

    Tukey's Mean Difference Plot (also known as a Bland-Altman plot) is a
    graphical method to analyze the differences between two methods of
    measurement. The mean of the measures is plotted against their difference.

    For more information see
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bland-Altman_plot

    Parameters
    ----------
    m1 : array_like
        A 1-d array.
    m2 : array_like
        A 1-d array.
    sd_limit : float
        The limit of agreements expressed in terms of the standard deviation of
        the differences. If `md` is the mean of the differences, and `sd` is
        the standard deviation of those differences, then the limits of
        agreement that will be plotted are md +/- sd_limit * sd.
        The default of 1.96 will produce 95% confidence intervals for the means
        of the differences. If sd_limit = 0, no limits will be plotted, and
        the ylimit of the plot defaults to 3 standard deviations on either
        side of the mean.
    ax : AxesSubplot
        If `ax` is None, then a figure is created. If an axis instance is
        given, the mean difference plot is drawn on the axis.
    scatter_kwds : dict
        Options to to style the scatter plot. Accepts any keywords for the
        matplotlib Axes.scatter plotting method
    mean_line_kwds : dict
        Options to to style the scatter plot. Accepts any keywords for the
        matplotlib Axes.axhline plotting method
    limit_lines_kwds : dict
        Options to to style the scatter plot. Accepts any keywords for the
        matplotlib Axes.axhline plotting method

    Returns
    -------
    Figure
        If `ax` is None, the created figure.  Otherwise the figure to which
        `ax` is connected.
