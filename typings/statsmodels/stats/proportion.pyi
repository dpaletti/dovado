def proportion_confint(count, nobs, alpha=..., method=...):
    '''confidence interval for a binomial proportion

    Parameters
    ----------
    count : int or array_array_like
        number of successes, can be pandas Series or DataFrame
    nobs : int
        total number of trials
    alpha : float in (0, 1)
        significance level, default 0.05
    method : {'normal', 'agresti_coull', 'beta', 'wilson', 'binom_test'}
        default: 'normal'
        method to use for confidence interval,
        currently available methods :

         - `normal` : asymptotic normal approximation
         - `agresti_coull` : Agresti-Coull interval
         - `beta` : Clopper-Pearson interval based on Beta distribution
         - `wilson` : Wilson Score interval
         - `jeffreys` : Jeffreys Bayesian Interval
         - `binom_test` : experimental, inversion of binom_test

    Returns
    -------
    ci_low, ci_upp : float, ndarray, or pandas Series or DataFrame
        lower and upper confidence level with coverage (approximately) 1-alpha.
        When a pandas object is returned, then the index is taken from the
        `count`.

    Notes
    -----
    Beta, the Clopper-Pearson exact interval has coverage at least 1-alpha,
    but is in general conservative. Most of the other methods have average
    coverage equal to 1-alpha, but will have smaller coverage in some cases.

    The 'beta' and 'jeffreys' interval are central, they use alpha/2 in each
    tail, and alpha is not adjusted at the boundaries. In the extreme case
    when `count` is zero or equal to `nobs`, then the coverage will be only
    1 - alpha/2 in the case of 'beta'.

    The confidence intervals are clipped to be in the [0, 1] interval in the
    case of 'normal' and 'agresti_coull'.

    Method "binom_test" directly inverts the binomial test in scipy.stats.
    which has discrete steps.

    TODO: binom_test intervals raise an exception in small samples if one
       interval bound is close to zero or one.

def multinomial_proportions_confint(counts, alpha=..., method=...):
    '''Confidence intervals for multinomial proportions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    counts : array_like of int, 1-D
        Number of observations in each category.
    alpha : float in (0, 1), optional
        Significance level, defaults to 0.05.
    method : {'goodman', 'sison-glaz'}, optional
        Method to use to compute the confidence intervals; available methods
        are:

         - `goodman`: based on a chi-squared approximation, valid if all
           values in `counts` are greater or equal to 5 [2]_
         - `sison-glaz`: less conservative than `goodman`, but only valid if
           `counts` has 7 or more categories (``len(counts) >= 7``) [3]_

    Returns
    -------
    confint : ndarray, 2-D
        Array of [lower, upper] confidence levels for each category, such that
        overall coverage is (approximately) `1-alpha`.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `alpha` is not in `(0, 1)` (bounds excluded), or if the values in
        `counts` are not all positive or null.
    NotImplementedError
        If `method` is not kown.
    Exception
        When ``method == 'sison-glaz'``, if for some reason `c` cannot be
        computed; this signals a bug and should be reported.

    Notes
    -----
    The `goodman` method [2]_ is based on approximating a statistic based on
    the multinomial as a chi-squared random variable. The usual recommendation
    is that this is valid if all the values in `counts` are greater than or
    equal to 5. There is no condition on the number of categories for this
    method.

    The `sison-glaz` method [3]_ approximates the multinomial probabilities,
    and evaluates that with a maximum-likelihood estimator. The first
    approximation is an Edgeworth expansion that converges when the number of
    categories goes to infinity, and the maximum-likelihood estimator converges
    when the number of observations (``sum(counts)``) goes to infinity. In
    their paper, Sison & Glaz demo their method with at least 7 categories, so
    ``len(counts) >= 7`` with all values in `counts` at or above 5 can be used
    as a rule of thumb for the validity of this method. This method is less
    conservative than the `goodman` method (i.e. it will yield confidence
    intervals closer to the desired significance level), but produces
    confidence intervals of uniform width over all categories (except when the
    intervals reach 0 or 1, in which case they are truncated), which makes it
    most useful when proportions are of similar magnitude.

    Aside from the original sources ([1]_, [2]_, and [3]_), the implementation
    uses the formulas (though not the code) presented in [4]_ and [5]_.

    '''Power of proportions equivalence test based on normal distribution

    Parameters
    ----------
    low, upp : floats
        lower and upper limit of equivalence region
    nobs : int
        number of observations
    p_alt : float in (0,1)
        proportion under the alternative
    alpha : float in (0,1)
        significance level of the test
    dist : str in ['norm', 'binom']
        This defines the distribution to evaluate the power of the test. The
        critical values of the TOST test are always based on the normal
        approximation, but the distribution for the power can be either the
        normal (default) or the binomial (exact) distribution.
    variance_prop : None or float in (0,1)
        If this is None, then the variances for the two one sided tests are
        based on the proportions equal to the equivalence limits.
        If variance_prop is given, then it is used to calculate the variance
        for the TOST statistics. If this is based on an sample, then the
        estimated proportion can be used.
    discrete : bool
        If true, then the critical values of the rejection region are converted
        to integers. If dist is "binom", this is automatically assumed.
        If discrete is false, then the TOST critical values are used as
        floating point numbers, and the power is calculated based on the
        rejection region that is not discretized.
    continuity : bool or float
        adjust the rejection region for the normal power probability. This has
        and effect only if ``dist='norm'``
    critval_continuity : bool or float
        If this is non-zero, then the critical values of the tost rejection
        region are adjusted before converting to integers. This affects both
        distributions, ``dist='norm'`` and ``dist='binom'``.

    Returns
    -------
    power : float
        statistical power of the equivalence test.
    (k_low, k_upp, z_low, z_upp) : tuple of floats
        critical limits in intermediate steps
        temporary return, will be changed

    Notes
    -----
    In small samples the power for the ``discrete`` version, has a sawtooth
    pattern as a function of the number of observations. As a consequence,
    small changes in the number of observations or in the normal approximation
    can have a large effect on the power.

    ``continuity`` and ``critval_continuity`` are added to match some results
    of PASS, and are mainly to investigate the sensitivity of the ztost power
    to small changes in the rejection region. From my interpretation of the
    equations in the SAS manual, both are zero in SAS.

    works vectorized

    **verification:**

    The ``dist='binom'`` results match PASS,
    The ``dist='norm'`` results look reasonable, but no benchmark is available.

def proportions_ztest(count, nobs, value=..., alternative=..., prop_var=...):
    """
    Test for proportions based on normal (z) test

    Parameters
    ----------
    count : {int, array_like}
        the number of successes in nobs trials. If this is array_like, then
        the assumption is that this represents the number of successes for
        each independent sample
    nobs : {int, array_like}
        the number of trials or observations, with the same length as
        count.
    value : float, array_like or None, optional
        This is the value of the null hypothesis equal to the proportion in the
        case of a one sample test. In the case of a two-sample test, the
        null hypothesis is that prop[0] - prop[1] = value, where prop is the
        proportion in the two samples. If not provided value = 0 and the null
        is prop[0] = prop[1]
    alternative : str in ['two-sided', 'smaller', 'larger']
        The alternative hypothesis can be either two-sided or one of the one-
        sided tests, smaller means that the alternative hypothesis is
        ``prop < value`` and larger means ``prop > value``. In the two sample
        test, smaller means that the alternative hypothesis is ``p1 < p2`` and
        larger means ``p1 > p2`` where ``p1`` is the proportion of the first
        sample and ``p2`` of the second one.
    prop_var : False or float in (0, 1)
        If prop_var is false, then the variance of the proportion estimate is
        calculated based on the sample proportion. Alternatively, a proportion
        can be specified to calculate this variance. Common use case is to
        use the proportion under the Null hypothesis to specify the variance
        of the proportion estimate.

    Returns
    -------
    zstat : float
        test statistic for the z-test
    p-value : float
        p-value for the z-test

    Examples
    --------
    >>> count = 5

    Notes
    -----
    This uses a simple normal test for proportions. It should be the same as
    running the mean z-test on the data encoded 1 for event and 0 for no event
    so that the sum corresponds to the count.

    In the one and two sample cases with two-sided alternative, this test
    produces the same p-value as ``proportions_chisquare``, since the
    chisquare is the distribution of the square of a standard normal
    distribution.
