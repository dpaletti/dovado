        scale : str or float, optional
            `scale` can be 'X2', 'dev', or a float
            The default value is None, which uses `X2` for Gamma, Gaussian,
            and Inverse Gaussian.
            `X2` is Pearson's chi-square divided by `df_resid`.
            The default is 1 for the Binomial and Poisson families.
            `dev` is the deviance divided by df_resid
        cov_type : str

            If True, the Student t-distribution is used for inference.
        full_output : bool, optional
            Set to True to have all available output in the Results object's
            mle_retvals attribute. The output is dependent on the solver.
            See LikelihoodModelResults notes section for more information.

        rtol : float, optional
            (available with IRLS fits) The relative tolerance criterion that

            specifies which linear algebra function to use for the irls
            optimization. Default is `lstsq` which uses the same underlying
            svd based approach as 'pinv', but is faster during iterations.
            'lstsq' and 'pinv' regularize the estimate in singular and
            near-singular cases by truncating small singular values based
            on `rcond` of the respective numpy.linalg function. 'qr' is
            only valid for cases that are not singular nor near-singular.
        optim_hessian : {'eim', 'oim'}, optional
            (available with scipy optimizer fits) When 'oim'--the default--the
            observed Hessian is used in fitting. 'eim' is the expected Hessian.
            This may provide more stable fits, but adds assumption that the
            Hessian is correctly specified.

        alpha : scalar or array_like
            The penalty weight.  If a scalar, the same penalty weight
            applies to all variables in the model.  If a vector, it
            must have the same length as `params`, and contains a

            An array or a GLMResults object, same type returned by `fit`.

        Notes
        -----
        The penalty is the ``elastic net`` penalty, which is a
        combination of L1 and L2 penalties.

        The function that is minimized is:

        .. math::

            -loglike/n + alpha*((1-L1\_wt)*|params|_2^2/2 + L1\_wt*|params|_1)

        where :math:`|*|_1` and :math:`|*|_2` are the L1 and L2 norms.

        Post-estimation results are based on the same data used to
        select variables, hence may be subject to overfitting biases.

        The elastic_net method uses the following keyword arguments:

        maxiter : int
            Maximum number of iterations
        L1_wt  : float
            Must be in [0, 1].  The L1 penalty has weight L1_wt and the

        cnvrg_tol : float

            one sweep through all coefficients.
