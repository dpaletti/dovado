    Parameters
    ----------
    pvals_raw : array_like, 1-D
        p-values from a pairwise comparison test
    all_pairs : list of tuples
        list of indices, one pair for each comparison
    multitest_method : str
        method that is used by default for p-value correction. This is used
        as default by the methods like if the multiple-testing method is not
        specified as argument.
    levels : {list[str], None}
        optional names of the levels or groups
    n_levels : None or int
        If None, then the number of levels or groups is inferred from the
        other arguments. It can be explicitly specified, if the inferred
        number is incorrect.

    Notes
    -----
    This class can also be used for other pairwise comparisons, for example
    comparing several treatments to a control (as in Dunnet's test).
