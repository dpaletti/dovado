Overview
--------

This module implements the Multiple Imputation through Chained
Equations (MICE) approach to handling missing data in statistical data
analyses. The approach has the following steps:

0. Impute each missing value with the mean of the observed values of
the same variable.

1. For each variable in the data set with missing values (termed the
'focus variable'), do the following:

1a. Fit an 'imputation model', which is a regression model for the
focus variable, regressed on the observed and (current) imputed values
of some or all of the other variables.

1b. Impute the missing values for the focus variable.  Currently this
imputation must use the 'predictive mean matching' (pmm) procedure.

2. Once all variables have been imputed, fit the 'analysis model' to
the data set.

3. Repeat steps 1-2 multiple times and combine the results using a
'combining rule' to produce point estimates of all parameters in the
analysis model and standard errors for them.

The imputations for each variable are based on an imputation model
that is specified via a model class and a formula for the regression
relationship.  The default model is OLS, with a formula specifying
main effects for all other variables.

The MICE procedure can be used in one of two ways:

* If the goal is only to produce imputed data sets, the MICEData class
can be used to wrap a data frame, providing facilities for doing the
imputation.  Summary plots are available for assessing the performance
of the imputation.

* If the imputed data sets are to be used to fit an additional
'analysis model', a MICE instance can be used.  After specifying the
MICE instance and running it, the results are combined using the
`combine` method.  Results and various summary plots are then
available.

Terminology
-----------

The primary goal of the analysis is usually to fit and perform
inference using an 'analysis model'. If an analysis model is not
specified, then imputed datasets are produced for later use.

The MICE procedure involves a family of imputation models.  There is
one imputation model for each variable with missing values.  An
imputation model may be conditioned on all or a subset of the
remaining variables, using main effects, transformations,
interactions, etc. as desired.

A 'perturbation method' is a method for setting the parameter estimate
in an imputation model.  The 'gaussian' perturbation method first fits
the model (usually using maximum likelihood, but it could use any
statsmodels fit procedure), then sets the parameter vector equal to a
draw from the Gaussian approximation to the sampling distribution for
the fit.  The 'bootstrap' perturbation method sets the parameter
vector equal to a fitted parameter vector obtained when fitting the
conditional model to a bootstrapped version of the data set.

Class structure
---------------

There are two main classes in the module:

* 'MICEData' wraps a Pandas dataframe, incorporating information about
  the imputation model for each variable with missing values. It can
  be used to produce multiply imputed data sets that are to be further
  processed or distributed to other researchers.  A number of plotting
  procedures are provided to visualize the imputation results and
  missing data patterns.  The `history_func` hook allows any features
  of interest of the imputed data sets to be saved for further
  analysis.

* 'MICE' takes both a 'MICEData' object and an analysis model
  specification.  It runs the multiple imputation, fits the analysis
  models, and combines the results to produce a `MICEResults` object.
  The summary method of this results object can be used to see the key
  estimands and inferential quantities.

Notes
-----

By default, to conserve memory 'MICEData' saves very little
information from one iteration to the next.  The data set passed by
the user is copied on entry, but then is over-written each time new
imputations are produced.  If using 'MICE', the fitted
analysis models and results are saved.  MICEData includes a
`history_callback` hook that allows arbitrary information from the
intermediate datasets to be saved for future use.
