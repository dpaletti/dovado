    Canonical correlation analysis using singular value decomposition

    For matrices exog=x and endog=y, find projections x_cancoef and y_cancoef
    such that:

        x1 = x * x_cancoef, x1' * x1 is identity matrix
        y1 = y * y_cancoef, y1' * y1 is identity matrix

    and the correlation between x1 and y1 is maximized.

    Attributes
    ----------
    endog : ndarray
        See Parameters.
    exog : ndarray
        See Parameters.
    cancorr : ndarray
        The canonical correlation values
    y_cancoeff : ndarray
        The canonical coefficients for endog
    x_cancoeff : ndarray
        The canonical coefficients for exog
