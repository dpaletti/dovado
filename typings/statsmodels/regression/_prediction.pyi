class PredictionResults(object):

    Results class for predictions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    predicted_mean : ndarray
        The array containing the prediction means.
    var_pred_mean : ndarray
        The array of the variance of the prediction means.
    var_resid : ndarray
        The array of residual variances.
    df : int
        The degree of freedom used if dist is 't'.
    dist : {'norm', 't', object}
        Either a string for the normal or t distribution or another object
        that exposes a `ppf` method.
    row_labels : list[str]
        Row labels used in summary frame.

        Returns the confidence interval of the value, `effect` of the

        This is currently only available for t and z tests.

        Parameters
        ----------
        alpha : float, optional
            The significance level for the confidence interval.
            ie., The default `alpha` = .05 returns a 95% confidence interval.

        Returns
        -------
        ci : ndarray, (k_constraints, 2)
            The array has the lower and the upper limit of the confidence
            interval in the columns.

    """
    Compute prediction results.

    Parameters
    ----------
    exog : array_like, optional
        The values for which you want to predict.
    transform : bool, optional
        If the model was fit via a formula, do you want to pass
        exog through the formula. Default is True. E.g., if you fit
        a model y ~ log(x1) + log(x2), and transform is True, then
        you can pass a data structure that contains x1 and x2 in
        their original form. Otherwise, you'd need to log the data
        first.
    weights : array_like, optional
        Weights interpreted as in WLS, used for the variance of the predicted
        residual.
    row_labels : list
        A list of row labels to use.  If not provided, read `exog` is
        available.
    **kwargs
        Some models can take additional keyword arguments, see the predict
        method of the model for the details.

    Returns
    -------
    linear_model.PredictionResults
        The prediction results instance contains prediction and prediction
        variance and can on demand calculate confidence intervals and summary
        tables for the prediction of the mean and of new observations.
