def wls_prediction_std(res, exog=..., weights=..., alpha=...):
    '''calculate standard deviation and confidence interval for prediction

    applies to WLS and OLS, not to general GLS,
    that is independently but not identically distributed observations

    Parameters
    ----------
    res : regression result instance
        results of WLS or OLS regression required attributes see notes
    exog : array_like (optional)
        exogenous variables for points to predict
    weights : scalar or array_like (optional)
        weights as defined for WLS (inverse of variance of observation)
    alpha : float (default: alpha = 0.05)
        confidence level for two-sided hypothesis

    Returns
    -------
    predstd : array_like, 1d
        standard error of prediction
        same length as rows of exog
    interval_l, interval_u : array_like
        lower und upper confidence bounds

    Notes
    -----
    The result instance needs to have at least the following
    res.model.predict() : predicted values or
    res.fittedvalues : values used in estimation
    res.cov_params() : covariance matrix of parameter estimates

    If exog is 1d, then it is interpreted as one observation,
    i.e. a row vector.

    testing status: not compared with other packages
