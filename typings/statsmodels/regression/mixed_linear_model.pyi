Linear mixed effects models are regression models for dependent data.
They can be used to estimate regression relationships involving both
means and variances.

These models are also known as multilevel linear models, and
hierarchical linear models.

The MixedLM class fits linear mixed effects models to data, and
provides support for some common post-estimation tasks.  This is a
group-based implementation that is most efficient for models in which
the data can be partitioned into independent groups.  Some models with
crossed effects can be handled by specifying a model with a single
group.

The data are partitioned into disjoint groups.  The probability model
for group i is:

Y = X*beta + Z*gamma + epsilon

where

* n_i is the number of observations in group i

* Y is a n_i dimensional response vector (called endog in MixedLM)

* X is a n_i x k_fe dimensional design matrix for the fixed effects
  (called exog in MixedLM)

* beta is a k_fe-dimensional vector of fixed effects parameters
  (called fe_params in MixedLM)

* Z is a design matrix for the random effects with n_i rows (called
  exog_re in MixedLM).  The number of columns in Z can vary by group
  as discussed below.

* gamma is a random vector with mean 0.  The covariance matrix for the
  first `k_re` elements of `gamma` (called cov_re in MixedLM) is
  common to all groups.  The remaining elements of `gamma` are
  variance components as discussed in more detail below. Each group
  receives its own independent realization of gamma.

* epsilon is a n_i dimensional vector of iid normal
  errors with mean 0 and variance sigma^2; the epsilon
  values are independent both within and between groups

Y, X and Z must be entirely observed.  beta, Psi, and sigma^2 are
estimated using ML or REML estimation, and gamma and epsilon are
random so define the probability model.

The marginal mean structure is E[Y | X, Z] = X*beta.  If only the mean
structure is of interest, GEE is an alternative to using linear mixed
models.

Two types of random effects are supported.  Standard random effects
are correlated with each other in arbitrary ways.  Every group has the
same number (`k_re`) of standard random effects, with the same joint
distribution (but with independent realizations across the groups).

Variance components are uncorrelated with each other, and with the
standard random effects.  Each variance component has mean zero, and
all realizations of a given variance component have the same variance
parameter.  The number of realized variance components per variance
parameter can differ across the groups.

The primary reference for the implementation details is:

linear mixed effects models for repeated measures data".  Journal of
the American Statistical Association. Volume 83, Issue 404, pages

All the likelihood, gradient, and Hessian calculations closely follow
Lindstrom and Bates 1988, adapted to support variance components.

The following two documents are written more from the perspective of
users:

Notation:

* `cov_re` is the random effects covariance matrix (referred to above
  as Psi) and `scale` is the (scalar) error variance.  For a single
  group, the marginal covariance matrix of endog given exog is scale*I
  + Z * cov_re * Z', where Z is the design matrix for the random
  effects in one group.

* `vcomp` is a vector of variance parameters.  The length of `vcomp`
  is determined by the number of keys in either the `exog_vc` argument
  to ``MixedLM``, or the `vc_formula` argument when using formulas to
  fit a model.

Notes:

1. Three different parameterizations are used in different places.
The regression slopes (usually called `fe_params`) are identical in
all three parameterizations, but the variance parameters differ.  The
parameterizations are:

* The "user parameterization" in which cov(endog) = scale*I + Z *
  cov_re * Z', as described above.  This is the main parameterization
  visible to the user.

* The "profile parameterization" in which cov(endog) = I +
  Z * cov_re1 * Z'.  This is the parameterization of the profile
  likelihood that is maximized to produce parameter estimates.
  (see Lindstrom and Bates for details).  The "user" cov_re is
  equal to the "profile" cov_re1 times the scale.

* The "square root parameterization" in which we work with the Cholesky
  factor of cov_re1 instead of cov_re directly.  This is hidden from the
  user.

All three parameterizations can be packed into a vector by
(optionally) concatenating `fe_params` together with the lower
triangle or Cholesky square root of the dependence structure, followed
by the variance parameters for the variance components.  The are
stored as square roots if (and only if) the random effects covariance
matrix is stored as its Cholesky factor.  Note that when unpacking, it
is important to either square or reflect the dependence structure
depending on which parameterization is being used.

Two score methods are implemented.  One takes the score with respect
to the elements of the random effects covariance matrix (used for
inference once the MLE is reached), and the other takes the score with
respect to the parameters of the Cholesky square root of the random
effects covariance matrix (used for optimization).

The numerical optimization uses GLS to avoid explicitly optimizing
over the fixed effects parameters.  The likelihood that is optimized
is profiled over both the scale parameter (a scalar) and the fixed
effects parameters (if any).  As a result of this profiling, it is
difficult and unnecessary to calculate the Hessian of the profiled log
likelihood function, so that calculation is not implemented here.
Therefore, optimization methods requiring the Hessian matrix such as
the Newton-Raphson algorithm cannot be used for model fitting.

    exog : 2d array_like
        A matrix of covariates used to determine the
        mean structure (the "fixed effects" covariates).
    groups : 1d array_like
        A vector of labels determining the groups -- data from

        lower triangle of the random effects covariance matrix.
    missing : str
        The approach to missing data handling

    Notes
    -----
    If `exog_vc` is not a `VCSpec` instance, then it must be a
    dictionary of dictionaries.  Specifically, `exog_vc[a][g]` is a
    matrix whose columns are linearly combined using independent
    random coefficients.  This random term then contributes to the
    variance structure of the data for group `g`.  The random
    coefficients all have mean zero, and have the same variance.  The
    matrix must be `m x k`, where `m` is the number of observations in
    group `g`.  The number of columns may differ among the top-level
    groups.

    The covariates in `exog`, `exog_re` and `exog_vc` may (but need
    not) partially or wholly overlap.

    `use_sqrt` should almost always be set to True.  The main use case
    for use_sqrt=False is when complicated patterns of fixed values in
    the covariance structure are set (using the `free` argument to
    `fit`) that cannot be expressed in terms of the Cholesky factor L.

    Examples
    --------
    A basic mixed model with fixed effects for the columns of
    ``exog`` and a random intercept for each distinct value of
    ``group``:

    >>> model = sm.MixedLM(endog, exog, groups)
    >>> result = model.fit()

    A mixed model with fixed effects for the columns of ``exog`` and
    correlated random coefficients for the columns of ``exog_re``:

    >>> model = sm.MixedLM(endog, exog, groups, exog_re=exog_re)
    >>> result = model.fit()

    A mixed model with fixed effects for the columns of ``exog`` and
    independent random coefficients for the columns of ``exog_re``:

    >>> free = MixedLMParams.from_components(
                     fe_params=np.ones(exog.shape[1]),
                     cov_re=np.eye(exog_re.shape[1]))
    >>> model = sm.MixedLM(endog, exog, groups, exog_re=exog_re)
    >>> result = model.fit(free=free)

    A different way to specify independent random coefficients for the
    columns of ``exog_re``.  In this example ``groups`` must be a
    Pandas Series with compatible indexing with ``exog_re``, and
    ``exog_re`` has two columns.

            indicating the depth of the namespace to use. For example, the
            default ``eval_env=0`` uses the calling namespace. If you wish
            to use a "clean" environment set ``eval_env=-1``.

        Returns
        -------
        model : Model instance

        Notes
        -----
        `data` must define __getitem__ with the keys in the formula
        terms args and kwargs are passed on to the model
        instantiation. E.g., a numpy structured or rec array, a
        dictionary, or a pandas DataFrame.

        If the variance component is intended to produce random
        intercepts for disjoint subsets of a group, specified by
        string labels or a categorical data value, always use '0 +' in
        the formula so that no overall intercept is included.

        If the variance components specify random slopes and you do
        not also want a random group-level intercept in the model,
        then use '0 +' in the formula to exclude the intercept.

        The variance components formulas are processed separately for
        each group.  If a variable is categorical the results will not
        be affected by whether the group labels are distinct or
        re-used over the top-level groups.

        Examples
        --------
        Suppose we have data from an educational study with students
        nested in classrooms nested in schools.  The students take a
        test, and we want to relate the test scores to the students'
        ages, while accounting for the effects of classrooms and
        schools.  The school will be the top-level group, and the
        classroom is a nested group that is specified as a variance
        component.  Note that the schools may have different number of
        classrooms, and the classroom labels may (but need not be)
        different across the schools.

        >>> vc = {'classroom': '0 + C(classroom)'}
        >>> MixedLM.from_formula('test_score ~ age', vc_formula=vc, \
                                  re_formula='1', groups='school', data=data)

        Now suppose we also have a previous test score called
        'pretest'.  If we want the relationship between pretest
        scores and the current test to vary by classroom, we can
        specify a random slope for the pretest score

        >>> vc = {'classroom': '0 + C(classroom)', 'pretest': '0 + pretest'}
        >>> MixedLM.from_formula('test_score ~ age + pretest', vc_formula=vc, \
                                  re_formula='1', groups='school', data=data)

        The following model is almost equivalent to the previous one,
        but here the classroom random intercept and pretest slope may
        be correlated.

        >>> vc = {'classroom': '0 + C(classroom)'}
        >>> MixedLM.from_formula('test_score ~ age + pretest', vc_formula=vc, \
