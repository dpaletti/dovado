    Parameters
    ----------
    k_endog : {array_like, int}
        The observed time-series process :math:`y` if array like or the
        number of variables in the process if an integer.
    k_states : int
        The dimension of the unobserved state process.
    k_posdef : int, optional
        The dimension of a guaranteed positive definite covariance matrix
        describing the shocks in the measurement equation. Must be less than
        or equal to `k_states`. Default is `k_states`.
    simulation_smooth_results_class : class, optional
        Default results class to use to save output of simulation smoothing.
        Default is `SimulationSmoothResults`. If specified, class must extend
        from `SimulationSmoothResults`.
    simulation_smoother_classes : dict, optional
        Dictionary with BLAS prefixes as keys and classes as values.
    **kwargs
        Keyword arguments may be used to provide default values for state space

        options, or for Simulation smoothing options.

        ----------

            Simulation output bitmask. If this is specified, it is simply
            returned and the other arguments are ignored.

            Whether or not to include the state in the simulation output.

        \*\*kwargs

        Retrieve a simulation smoother for the statespace model.

        Parameters
        ----------
        simulation_output : int, optional
            Determines which simulation smoother output is calculated.
            Default is all (including state and disturbances).
        method : {'kfs', 'cfa'}, optional
            Method for simulation smoothing. If `method='kfs'`, then the
            simulation smoother is based on Kalman filtering and smoothing
            recursions. If `method='cfa'`, then the simulation smoother is
            based on the Cholesky Factor Algorithm (CFA) approach. The CFA
            approach is not applicable to all state space models, but can be
            faster for the cases in which it is supported.
        simulation_smooth_results_class : class, optional
            Default results class to use to save output of simulation
            smoothing. Default is `SimulationSmoothResults`. If specified,
            class must extend from `SimulationSmoothResults`.
        prefix : str
            The prefix of the datatype. Usually only used internally.
        **kwargs
            Additional keyword arguments, used to set the simulation output.
