    Principal Component Analysis

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : array_like
        Variables in columns, observations in rows.
    ncomp : int, optional
        Number of components to return.  If None, returns the as many as the
        smaller of the number of rows or columns in data.
    standardize : bool, optional
        Flag indicating to use standardized data with mean 0 and unit
        variance.  standardized being True implies demean.  Using standardized
        data is equivalent to computing principal components from the
        correlation matrix of data.
    demean : bool, optional
        Flag indicating whether to demean data before computing principal
        components.  demean is ignored if standardize is True. Demeaning data
        but not standardizing is equivalent to computing principal components
        from the covariance matrix of data.
    normalize : bool , optional
        Indicates whether to normalize the factors to have unit inner product.
        If False, the loadings will have unit inner product.
    gls : bool, optional
        Flag indicating to implement a two-step GLS estimator where
        in the first step principal components are used to estimate residuals,
        and then the inverse residual variance is used as a set of weights to
        estimate the final principal components.  Setting gls to True requires
        ncomp to be less then the min of the number of rows or columns.
    weights : ndarray, optional
        Series weights to use after transforming data according to standardize
        or demean when computing the principal components.
    method : str, optional
        Sets the linear algebra routine used to compute eigenvectors:

        * 'svd' uses a singular value decomposition (default).
        * 'eig' uses an eigenvalue decomposition of a quadratic form
        * 'nipals' uses the NIPALS algorithm and can be faster than SVD when
          ncomp is small and nvars is large. See notes about additional changes
          when using NIPALS.
    missing : {str, None}
        Method for missing data.  Choices are:

        * 'drop-row' - drop rows with missing values.
        * 'drop-col' - drop columns with missing values.
        * 'drop-min' - drop either rows or columns, choosing by data retention.
        * 'fill-em' - use EM algorithm to fill missing value.  ncomp should be
          set to the number of factors required.
        * `None` raises if data contains NaN values.
    tol : float, optional
        Tolerance to use when checking for convergence when using NIPALS.
    max_iter : int, optional
        Maximum iterations when using NIPALS.
    tol_em : float
        Tolerance to use when checking for convergence of the EM algorithm.
    max_em_iter : int
        Maximum iterations for the EM algorithm.

    Attributes
    ----------
    factors : array or DataFrame
        nobs by ncomp array of of principal components (scores)
    scores :  array or DataFrame
        nobs by ncomp array of of principal components - identical to factors
    loadings : array or DataFrame
        ncomp by nvar array of  principal component loadings for constructing
        the factors
    coeff : array or DataFrame
        nvar by ncomp array of  principal component loadings for constructing
        the projections
    projection : array or DataFrame
        nobs by var array containing the projection of the data onto the ncomp
        estimated factors
    rsquare : array or Series
        ncomp array where the element in the ith position is the R-square
        of including the fist i principal components.  Note: values are
        calculated on the transformed data, not the original data
    ic : array or DataFrame
        ncomp by 3 array containing the Bai and Ng (2003) Information
        criteria.  Each column is a different criteria, and each row
        represents the number of included factors.
    eigenvals : array or Series
        nvar array of eigenvalues
    eigenvecs : array or DataFrame
        nvar by nvar array of eigenvectors
    weights : ndarray
        nvar array of weights used to compute the principal components,
        normalized to unit length
    transformed_data : ndarray
        Standardized, demeaned and weighted data used to compute
        principal components and related quantities
    cols : ndarray
        Array of indices indicating columns used in the PCA
    rows : ndarray
        Array of indices indicating rows used in the PCA

    Notes
    -----
    The default options perform principal component analysis on the
    demeaned, unit variance version of data.  Setting standardize to False
    will instead only demean, and setting both standardized and
    demean to False will not alter the data.

    Once the data have been transformed, the following relationships hold when
    the number of components (ncomp) is the same as tne minimum of the number
    of observation or the number of variables.

    .. math:

        X' X = V \\Lambda V'

    .. math:

        F = X V

    .. math:

        X = F V'

    where X is the `data`, F is the array of principal components (`factors`
    or `scores`), and V is the array of eigenvectors (`loadings`) and V' is
    the array of factor coefficients (`coeff`).

    When weights are provided, the principal components are computed from the
    modified data

    .. math:

        \\Omega^{-\\frac{1}{2}} X

    where :math:`\\Omega` is a diagonal matrix composed of the weights. For
    example, when using the GLS version of PCA, the elements of :math:`\\Omega`
    will be the inverse of the variances of the residuals from

    .. math:

        X - F V'

    where the number of factors is less than the rank of X

    Examples
    --------
    Basic PCA using the correlation matrix of the data

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from statsmodels.multivariate.pca import PCA
    >>> x = np.random.randn(100)[:, None]
    >>> x = x + np.random.randn(100, 100)
    >>> pc = PCA(x)

    Note that the principal components are computed using a SVD and so the
    correlation matrix is never constructed, unless method='eig'.

    PCA using the covariance matrix of the data

    >>> pc = PCA(x, standardize=False)

    Limiting the number of factors returned to 1 computed using NIPALS

    >>> pc = PCA(x, ncomp=1, method='nipals')
    >>> pc.factors.shape
    (100, 1)
