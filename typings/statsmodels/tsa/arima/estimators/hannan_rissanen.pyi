    """
    Estimate ARMA parameters using Hannan-Rissanen procedure.

    Parameters
    ----------
    endog : array_like
        Input time series array, assumed to be stationary.
    ar_order : int
        Autoregressive order
    ma_order : int
        Moving average order
    demean : bool, optional
        Whether to estimate and remove the mean from the process prior to
        fitting the ARMA coefficients. Default is True.
    initial_ar_order : int, optional
        Order of long autoregressive process used for initial computation of
        residuals.
    unbiased : bool, optional
        Whether or not to apply the bias correction step. Default is True if
        the estimated coefficients from the previous step imply a stationary
        and invertible process and False otherwise.

    Returns
    -------
    parameters : SARIMAXParams object
    other_results : Bunch
        Includes three components: `spec`, containing the
        `SARIMAXSpecification` instance corresponding to the input arguments;
        `initial_ar_order`, containing the autoregressive lag order used in the
        first step; and `resid`, which contains the computed residuals from the
        last step.

    Notes
    -----
    The primary reference is [1]_, section 5.1.4, which describes a three-step
    procedure that we implement here.

    1. Fit a large-order AR model via Yule-Walker to estimate residuals
    2. Compute AR and MA estimates via least squares
    3. (Unless the estimated coefficients from step (2) are non-stationary /
       non-invertible or `unbiased=False`) Perform bias correction

    The order used for the AR model in the first step may be given as an
    argument. If it is not, we compute it as suggested by [2]_.

    The estimate of the variance that we use is computed from the residuals
    of the least-squares regression and not from the innovations algorithm.
    This is because our fast implementation of the innovations algorithm is
    only valid for stationary processes, and the Hannan-Rissanen procedure may
    produce estimates that imply non-stationary processes. To avoid
    inconsistency, we never compute this latter variance here, even if it is
    possible. See test_hannan_rissanen::test_brockwell_davis_example_517 for
    an example of how to compute this variance manually.

    This procedure assumes that the series is stationary, but if this is not
    true, it is still possible that this procedure will return parameters that
    imply a non-stationary / non-invertible process.

    Note that the third stage will only be applied if the parameters from the
    second stage imply a stationary / invertible model. If `unbiased=True` is
    given, then non-stationary / non-invertible parameters in the second stage
    will throw an exception.
