        kernels

    a) a list of n kernels which will be treated as

    or b) a single univariate kernel which will be applied radially to the

    In the case of the Gaussian these are both equivalent, and the second constructiong

        shape should be a function taking and returning numeric type.

        For sanity it should always return positive or zero but this is not
        enforced in case you want to do weird things. Bear in mind that the
        statistical tests etc. may not be valid for non-positive kernels.

        The bandwidth of the kernel is supplied as h.

        You may specify a domain as a list of 2 values [min, max], in which case
        kernel will be treated as zero outside these values. This will speed up
        calculation.

        You may also specify the normalisation constant for the supplied Kernel.
        If you do this number will be stored and used as the normalisation
        without calculation.  It is recommended you do this if you know the
        constant, to speed up calculation.  In particular if the shape function
        provided is already normalised you should provide norm = 1.0.

        Warning: I think several calculations assume that the kernel is
        normalized. No tests for non-normalized kernel.
