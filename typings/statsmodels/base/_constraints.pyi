class LinearConstraints(object):

    Affine constraints are defined as ``R b = q` where `R` is the constraints
    matrix and `q` are the constraints values and `b` are the parameters.

    This is in analogy to patsy's LinearConstraints class but can be pickled.

    Parameters
    ----------
    constraint_matrix : ndarray
        R matrix, 2-dim with number of columns equal to the number of
        parameters. Each row defines one constraint.
    constraint_values : ndarray
        1-dim array of constant values
    variable_names : list of strings
        parameter names, used only for display
    kwds : keyword arguments
        keywords are attached to the instance.

class TransformRestriction(object):
    """Transformation for linear constraints `R params = q`

    Note, the transformation from the reduced to the full parameters is an

    Parameters
    ----------
    R : array_like
        Linear restriction matrix
    q : arraylike or None
        values of the linear restrictions


    Notes
    -----
    The reduced parameters are not sorted with respect to constraints.

    TODO: error checking, eg. inconsistent constraints, how?

    Inconsistent constraints will raise an exception in the calculation of
    the constant or offset. However, homogeneous constraints, where q=0, will
    can have a solution where the relevant parameters are constraint to be
    zero, as in the following example::

        b1 + b2 = 0 and b1 + 2*b2 = 0, implies that b2 = 0.

    The transformation applied from full to reduced parameter space does not
    raise and exception if the constraint does not hold.
    TODO: maybe change this, what's the behavior in this case?


    The `reduce` transform is applied to the array of explanatory variables,
    `exog`, when transforming a linear model to impose the constraints.

    This is the exact formula for OLS and other linear models. It will be
    a local approximation for nonlinear models.

    TODO: Is Sinv always the covariance matrix?
    In the linear case it can be (X'X)^{-1} or sigmahat^2 (X'X)^{-1}.

    My guess is that this is the point in the subspace that satisfies
    the constraint that has minimum Mahalanobis distance. Proof ?

    """fit model subject to linear equality constraints

    The constraints are of the form   `R params = q`
    where R is the constraint_matrix and q is the vector of constraint_values.

    The estimation creates a new model with transformed design matrix,
    exog, and converts the results back to the original parameterization.


    Parameters
    ----------
    model: model instance
        An instance of a model, see limitations in Notes section
    constraint_matrix : array_like, 2D
        This is R in the linear equality constraint `R params = q`.
        The number of columns needs to be the same as the number of columns
        in exog.
    constraint_values :
        This is `q` in the linear equality constraint `R params = q`
        If it is a tuple, then the constraint needs to be given by two
        arrays (constraint_matrix, constraint_value), i.e. (R, q).
        Otherwise, the constraints can be given as strings or list of
        strings.
        see t_test for details
    start_params : None or array_like
        starting values for the optimization. `start_params` needs to be
        given in the original parameter space and are internally
        transformed.
    **fit_kwds : keyword arguments
        fit_kwds are used in the optimization of the transformed model.

    Returns
    -------
    params : ndarray ?
        estimated parameters (in the original parameterization
    cov_params : ndarray
        covariance matrix of the parameter estimates. This is a reverse
        transformation of the covariance matrix of the transformed model given
        by `cov_params()`
        Note: `fit_kwds` can affect the choice of covariance, e.g. by
        specifying `cov_type`, which will be reflected in the returned
        covariance.
    res_constr : results instance
        This is the results instance for the created transformed model.


    Notes
    -----
    Limitations:

    Models where the number of parameters is different from the number of
    columns of exog are not yet supported.

    Requires a model that implement an offset option.

    This is a development version for fit_constrained methods or

    It will not work correctly for all models because creating a new
    results instance is not standardized for use outside the `fit` methods,
    and might need adjustements for this.
