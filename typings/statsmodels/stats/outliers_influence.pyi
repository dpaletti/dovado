    """Ramsey's RESET specification test for linear models

    This is a general specification test, for additional non-linear effects

    Parameters
    ----------
    degree : int
        Maximum power to include in the RESET test.  Powers 0 and 1 are
        excluded, so that degree tests powers 2, ..., degree of the fitted
        values.

    Notes
    -----
    The test fits an auxiliary OLS regression where the design matrix, exog,
    is augmented by powers 2 to degree of the fitted values. Then it performs
    an F-test whether these additional terms are significant.

    If the p-value of the f-test is below a threshold, e.g. 0.1, then this
    indicates that there might be additional non-linear effects in the model
    and that the linear model is mis-specified.

    exog_idx is added to the linear regression. It is a measure for
    multicollinearity of the design matrix, exog.

    One recommendation is that if VIF is greater than 5, then the explanatory
    variable given by exog_idx is highly collinear with the other explanatory
    variables, and the parameter estimates will have large standard errors
    because of this.

    Parameters
    ----------
    exog : ndarray

    This currently subclasses GLMInfluence instead of the other way.
    No common superclass yet.
    This is another version before checking what is common

    Parameters
    ----------
    results : instance of results class
        This only works for model and results classes that have the necessary
        helper methods.
    other arguments are only to override default behavior and are used instead
    of the corresponding attribute of the results class.
    By default resid_pearson is used as resid.




    Attributes
    ----------
    hat_matrix_diag (hii) : This is the generalized leverage computed as the
        local derivative of fittedvalues (predicted mean) with respect to the
        observed response for each observation.
    d_params : Change in parameters computed with one Newton step using the
        full Hessian corrected by division by (1 - hii).
    dbetas : change in parameters divided by the standard error of parameters
        from the full model results, ``bse``.
    cooks_distance : quadratic form for change in parameters weighted by
        ``cov_params`` from the full model divided by the number of variables.
        It includes p-values based on the F-distribution which are only
        approximate outside of linear Gaussian models.
    resid_studentized : In the general MLE case resid_studentized are
        computed from the score residuals scaled by hessian factor and
        leverage. This does not use ``cov_params``.
    d_fittedvalues : local change of expected mean given the change in the
        parameters as computed in ``d_params``.
    d_fittedvalues_scaled : same as d_fittedvalues but scaled by the standard
        errors of a predicted mean of the response.
    params_one : is the one step parameter estimate computed as ``params``
        from the full sample minus ``d_params``.

    Notes
    -----
    MLEInfluence produces the same results as GLMInfluence (verified for GLM
    Binomial and Gaussian). There will be some differences for non-canonical
    links or if a robust cov_type is used.

    Warning: This does currently not work for constrained or penalized models,
    e.g. models estimated with fit_constrained or fit_regularized.

    This has not yet been tested for correctness when offset or exposure
    are used, although they should be supported by the code.

    status: experimental,
    This class will need changes to support different kinds of models, e.g.
    extra parameters in discrete.NegativeBinomial or two-part models like
    ZeroInflatedPoisson.

    possible outliers. (However, this is not yet available in an automated way.)

        local change in linear prediction.
    d_linpred_scale
        local change in linear prediction scaled by the standard errors for
        the prediction based on cov_params.

    Notes
    -----
    This has not yet been tested for correctness when offset or exposure
    are used, although they should be supported by the code.

    Some GLM specific measures like d_deviance are still missing.

    Computing an explicit leave-one-observation-out (LOOO) loop is included
    but no influence measures are currently computed from it.
