    Notes
    -----
    The CCPR plot provides a way to judge the effect of one regressor on the
    response variable by taking into account the effects of the other
    independent variables. The partial residuals plot is defined as
    Residuals + B_i*X_i versus X_i. The component adds the B_i*X_i versus
    X_i to show where the fitted line would lie. Care should be taken if X_i
    is highly correlated with any of the other independent variables. If this
    is the case, the variance evident in the plot will be an underestimate of
    the true variance.
