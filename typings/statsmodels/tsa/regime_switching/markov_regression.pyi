class MarkovRegression(markov_switching.MarkovSwitching):
    r"""
    First-order k-regime Markov switching regression model

    Parameters
    ----------
    endog : array_like
        The endogenous variable.
    k_regimes : int
        The number of regimes.
    trend : {'nc', 'c', 't', 'ct'}
        Whether or not to include a trend. To include an intercept, time trend,
        or both, set `trend='c'`, `trend='t'`, or `trend='ct'`. For no trend,
        set `trend='nc'`. Default is an intercept.
    exog : array_like, optional
        Array of exogenous regressors, shaped nobs x k.
    order : int, optional
        The order of the model describes the dependence of the likelihood on
        previous regimes. This depends on the model in question and should be
        set appropriately by subclasses.
    exog_tvtp : array_like, optional
        Array of exogenous or lagged variables to use in calculating
        time-varying transition probabilities (TVTP). TVTP is only used if this
        variable is provided. If an intercept is desired, a column of ones must
        be explicitly included in this array.
    switching_trend : bool or iterable, optional
        If a boolean, sets whether or not all trend coefficients are
        switching across regimes. If an iterable, should be of length equal
        to the number of trend variables, where each element is
        a boolean describing whether the corresponding coefficient is
        switching. Default is True.
    switching_exog : bool or iterable, optional
        If a boolean, sets whether or not all regression coefficients are
        switching across regimes. If an iterable, should be of length equal
        to the number of exogenous variables, where each element is
        a boolean describing whether the corresponding coefficient is
        switching. Default is True.
    switching_variance : bool, optional
        Whether or not there is regime-specific heteroskedasticity, i.e.
        whether or not the error term has a switching variance. Default is
        False.

    Notes
    -----
    This model is new and API stability is not guaranteed, although changes
    will be made in a backwards compatible way if possible.

    The model can be written as:

    .. math::

        y_t = a_{S_t} + x_t' \beta_{S_t} + \varepsilon_t \\
        \varepsilon_t \sim N(0, \sigma_{S_t}^2)

    i.e. the model is a dynamic linear regression where the coefficients and
    the variance of the error term may be switching across regimes.

    The `trend` is accommodated by prepending columns to the `exog` array. Thus
    if `trend='c'`, the passed `exog` array should not already have a column of
    ones.

        Notes
        -----
        These are not very sophisticated and / or good. We set equal transition
        probabilities and interpolate regression coefficients between zero and
        the OLS estimates, where the interpolation is based on the regime
        number. We rely heavily on the EM algorithm to quickly find much better
        starting parameters, which are then used by the typical scoring
        approach.
