    State space representation of a time series process

    Parameters
    ----------
    k_endog : {array_like, int}
        The observed time-series process :math:`y` if array like or the
        number of variables in the process if an integer.
    k_states : int
        The dimension of the unobserved state process.
    k_posdef : int, optional
        The dimension of a guaranteed positive definite covariance matrix
        describing the shocks in the measurement equation. Must be less than
        or equal to `k_states`. Default is `k_states`.
    initial_variance : float, optional
        Initial variance used when approximate diffuse initialization is
        specified. Default is 1e6.
    initialization : Initialization object or str, optional
        Initialization method for the initial state. If a string, must be one
        of {'diffuse', 'approximate_diffuse', 'stationary', 'known'}.
    initial_state : array_like, optional
        If `initialization='known'` is used, the mean of the initial state's
        distribution.
    initial_state_cov : array_like, optional
        If `initialization='known'` is used, the covariance matrix of the
        initial state's distribution.
    nobs : int, optional
        If an endogenous vector is not given (i.e. `k_endog` is an integer),
        the number of observations can optionally be specified. If not
        specified, they will be set to zero until data is bound to the model.
    dtype : np.dtype, optional
        If an endogenous vector is not given (i.e. `k_endog` is an integer),
        the default datatype of the state space matrices can optionally be
        specified. Default is `np.float64`.
    design : array_like, optional
        The design matrix, :math:`Z`. Default is set to zeros.
    obs_intercept : array_like, optional
        The intercept for the observation equation, :math:`d`. Default is set
        to zeros.
    obs_cov : array_like, optional
        The covariance matrix for the observation equation :math:`H`. Default
        is set to zeros.
    transition : array_like, optional
        The transition matrix, :math:`T`. Default is set to zeros.
    state_intercept : array_like, optional
        The intercept for the transition equation, :math:`c`. Default is set to
        zeros.
    selection : array_like, optional
        The selection matrix, :math:`R`. Default is set to zeros.
    state_cov : array_like, optional
        The covariance matrix for the state equation :math:`Q`. Default is set
        to zeros.
    **kwargs
        Additional keyword arguments. Not used directly. It is present to
        improve compatibility with subclasses, so that they can use `**kwargs`
        to specify any default state space matrices (e.g. `design`) without
        having to clean out any other keyword arguments they might have been
        passed.

    Attributes
    ----------
    nobs : int
        The number of observations.
    k_endog : int
        The dimension of the observation series.
    k_states : int
        The dimension of the unobserved state process.
    k_posdef : int
        The dimension of a guaranteed positive
        definite covariance matrix describing
        the shocks in the measurement equation.
    shapes : dictionary of name:tuple
        A dictionary recording the initial shapes
        of each of the representation matrices as
        tuples.
    initialization : str
        Kalman filter initialization method. Default is unset.
    initial_variance : float
        Initial variance for approximate diffuse
        initialization. Default is 1e6.

    Notes
    -----
    A general state space model is of the form

    .. math::

        y_t & = Z_t \alpha_t + d_t + \varepsilon_t \\
        \alpha_t & = T_t \alpha_{t-1} + c_t + R_t \eta_t \\

    where :math:`y_t` refers to the observation vector at time :math:`t`,
    :math:`\alpha_t` refers to the (unobserved) state vector at time
    :math:`t`, and where the irregular components are defined as

    .. math::

        \varepsilon_t \sim N(0, H_t) \\
        \eta_t \sim N(0, Q_t) \\

    The remaining variables (:math:`Z_t, d_t, H_t, T_t, c_t, R_t, Q_t`) in the
    equations are matrices describing the process. Their variable names and
    dimensions are as follows

    Z : `design`          :math:`(k\_endog \times k\_states \times nobs)`

    d : `obs_intercept`   :math:`(k\_endog \times nobs)`

    H : `obs_cov`         :math:`(k\_endog \times k\_endog \times nobs)`

    T : `transition`      :math:`(k\_states \times k\_states \times nobs)`

    c : `state_intercept` :math:`(k\_states \times nobs)`

    R : `selection`       :math:`(k\_states \times k\_posdef \times nobs)`

    Q : `state_cov`       :math:`(k\_posdef \times k\_posdef \times nobs)`

    In the case that one of the matrices is time-invariant (so that, for
    example, :math:`Z_t = Z_{t+1} ~ \forall ~ t`), its last dimension may
    be of size :math:`1` rather than size `nobs`.

        Bind data to the statespace representation

        Parameters
        ----------
        endog : ndarray
            Endogenous data to bind to the model. Must be column-ordered
            ndarray with shape (`k_endog`, `nobs`) or row-ordered ndarray with
            shape (`nobs`, `k_endog`).

        Notes
        -----
        The strict requirements arise because the underlying statespace and
        Kalman filtering classes require Fortran-ordered arrays in the wide
        format (shaped (`k_endog`, `nobs`)), and this structure is setup to
        prevent copying arrays in memory.

        By default, numpy arrays are row (C)-ordered and most time series are
        represented in the long format (with time on the 0-th axis). In this
        case, no copying or re-ordering needs to be performed, instead the
        array can simply be transposed to get it in the right order and shape.

        Although this class (Representation) has stringent `bind` requirements,
        it is assumed that it will rarely be used directly.
