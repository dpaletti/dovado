        Notes
        -----
        This table decomposes updated forecasts of variables of interest from
        the `news` associated with each updated datapoint from the new data
        release.

        This table does not summarize the impacts or show the effect of
        revisions. That information can be found in the `impacts` table.

        This form of the details table is organized so that the impacted
        dates / variables are first in the index. This is convenient for
        slicing by impacted variables / dates to view the details of data
        updates for a particular variable or date.

        However, since the `forecast (prev)` and `observed` columns have a lot
        of duplication, printing the entire table gives a result that is less
        easy to parse than that produced by the `details_by_update` property.
        `details_by_update` contains the same information but is organized to
        be more convenient for displaying the entire table of detailed updates.
        At the same time, `details_by_update` is less convenient for
        subsetting.

        This table decomposes updated forecasts of variables of interest from
        the `news` associated with each updated datapoint from the new data
        release.

        This table does not summarize the impacts or show the effect of

        This form of the details table is organized so that the updated

        also contains the forecasts and observed values of the updates. This is
        convenient for displaying the entire table of detailed updates because
        it allows sparsifying duplicate entries.

        However, since it includes forecasts and observed values in the index
        of the table, it is not convenient for subsetting by the variable of
        interest. Instead, the `details_by_impact` property is organized to
        make slicing by impacted variables / dates easy. This allows, for
        example, viewing the details of data updates on a particular variable
        or date of interest.

        Returns
        -------
        details_table : SimpleTable or list of SimpleTable
            Table or list of tables describing how the news from each update
            (i.e. news from a particular variable / date) translates into
            changes to the forecasts of each impacted variable variable / date.

            This table contains information about the updates and about the
            impacts. Updates are newly observed datapoints that were not
            available in the previous results set. Each update leads to news,
            and the news may cause changes in the forecasts of the impacted
            variables. The amount that a particular piece of news (from an
            update to some variable at some date) impacts a variable at some
            date depends on weights that can be computed from the model
            results.

            The data contained in this table that refer to updates are:

            - `update date` : The date at which a new datapoint was added.
            - `updated variable` : The variable for which a new datapoint was
              added.
            - `forecast (prev)` : The value that had been forecast by the
              previous model for the given updated variable and date.
            - `observed` : The observed value of the new datapoint.
            - `news` : The news is the difference between the observed value
              and the previously forecast value for a given updated variable
              and date.

            The data contained in this table that refer to impacts are:

            - `impact date` : A date associated with an impact.
            - `impacted variable` : A variable that was impacted by the news.
            - `weight` : The weight of news from a given `update date` and
              `update variable` on a given `impacted variable` at a given
              `impact date`.
            - `impact` : The revision to the smoothed estimate / forecast of
              the impacted variable at the impact date based specifically on
              the news generated by the `updated variable` at the
              `update date`.

            data. Columns are:

            - `update date` : date associated with a new data point.
            - `updated variable` : variable for which new data was added at
              `update date`.
            - `forecast (prev)` : the forecast value for the updated variable
              at the update date in the previous results object (i.e. prior to
              the data being available).
            - `observed` : the observed value of the new datapoint.

        Create summary tables describing news and impacts

        Parameters
        ----------
        impact_date : int, str, datetime, list, array, or slice, optional
            Observation index label or slice of labels specifying particular
            impact periods to display. The impact date(s) describe the periods
            in which impacted variables were *affected* by the news. If this
            argument is given, the impact and details tables will only show
            this impact date or dates. Note that this argument is passed to the
            Pandas `loc` accessor, and so it should correspond to the labels of
            the model's index. If the model was created with data in a list or
            numpy array, then these labels will be zero-indexes observation
            integers.
        impacted_variable : str, list, array, or slice, optional
            Observation variable label or slice of labels specifying particular
            impacted variables to display. The impacted variable(s) describe
            the variables that were *affected* by the news. If you do not know
            the labels for the variables, check the `endog_names` attribute of
            the model instance.
        update_date : int, str, datetime, list, array, or slice, optional
            Observation index label or slice of labels specifying particular
            updated periods to display. The updated date(s) describe the
            periods in which the new data points were available that generated
            the news). See the note on `impact_date` for details about what
            these labels are.
        updated_variable : str, list, array, or slice, optional
            Observation variable label or slice of labels specifying particular
            updated variables to display. The updated variable(s) describe the
            variables that were *affected* by the news. If you do not know the
            labels for the variables, check the `endog_names` attribute of the
            model instance.
        impacts_groupby : {impact date, impacted date}
            The primary variable for grouping results in the impacts table. The
            default is to group by update date.
        details_groupby : str
            One of "update date", "updated date", "impact date", or
            "impacted date". The primary variable for grouping results in the
            details table. Only used if the details tables are included. The
            default is to group by update date.
        show_revisions_columns : bool, optional
            If set to False, the impacts table will not show the impacts from
            data revisions or the total impacts. Default is to show the
            revisions and totals columns if any revisions were made and
            otherwise to hide them.
        sparsify : bool, optional, default True
            Set to False for the table to include every one of the multiindex
            keys at each row.
        include_details_tables : bool, optional
            If set to True, the summary will show tables describing the details
            of how news from specific updates translate into specific impacts.
            These tables can be very long, particularly in cases where there
            were many updates and in multivariate models. The default is to
            show detailed tables only for univariate models.
        include_revisions_tables : bool, optional
            If set to True, the summary will show tables describing the
            revisions and updates that lead to impacts on variables of
            interest.
        float_format : str, optional
            Formatter format string syntax for converting numbers to strings.
            Default is '%.2f'.

        Returns
        -------
        summary_tables : Summary
            Summary tables describing news and impacts. Basic tables include:

            - A table with general information about the sample.
            - A table describing the impacts of revisions and news.
            - Tables describing revisions in the dataset since the previous
              results set (unless `include_revisions_tables=False`).

            In univariate models or if `include_details_tables=True`, one or
            more tables will additionally be included describing the details
            of how news from specific updates translate into specific impacts.
