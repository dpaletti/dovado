Notes
-----
Almost fully verified against R or Gretl, not all options are the same.
In many cases of Lagrange multiplier tests both the LM test and the F test is
returned. In some but not all cases, R has the option to choose the test
statistic. Some alternative test statistic results have not been verified.

TODO
* refactor to store intermediate results
* how easy is it to attach a test that is a class to a result instance,
  for example CompareCox as a method compare_cox(self, other) ?

missing:

* pvalues for breaks_hansen
* additional options, compare with R, check where ddof is appropriate
* new tests:
  - breaks_ap, more recent breaks tests
  - specification tests against nonparametric alternatives

    results_z : Result instance
        result instance of second model
    cov_type : str, default "nonrobust
        Covariance type. The default is "nonrobust` which uses the classic
        OLS covariance estimator. Specify one of "HC0", "HC1", "HC2", "HC3"
        to use White's covariance estimator. All covariance types supported
        by ``OLS.fit`` are accepted.
    cov_kwargs : dict, default None
        Dictionary of covariance options passed to ``OLS.fit``. See OLS.fit
        for more details.

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
        A DataFrame with two rows and four columns. The row labeled x
        contains results for the null that the model contained in
        results_x is equivalent to the encompassing model. The results in
        the row labeled z correspond to the test that the model contained
        in results_z are equivalent to the encompassing model. The columns
        are the test statistic, its p-value, and the numerator and
        denominator degrees of freedom. The test statistic has an F
        distribution. The numerator degree of freedom is the number of
        variables in the encompassing model that are not in the x or z model.
        The denominator degree of freedom is the number of observations minus
        the number of variables in the nesting model.

    Notes
    -----
    The null is that the fit produced using x is the same as the fit
    produced using both x and z. When testing whether x is encompassed,
    the model estimated is

    .. math::

        Y = X\beta + Z_1\gamma + \epsilon

    where :math:`Z_1` are the columns of :math:`Z` that are not spanned by
    :math:`X`. The null is :math:`H_0:\gamma=0`. When testing whether z is
    encompassed, the roles of :math:`X` and :math:`Z` are reversed.

    Implementation of  Davidson and MacKinnon (1993)'s encompassing test.
    Performs two Wald tests where models x and z are compared to a model
    that nests the two. The Wald tests are performed by using an OLS
    regression.

    """
    Ljung-Box test of autocorrelation in residuals.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        The data series. The data is demeaned before the test statistic is
        computed.
    lags : {int, array_like}, default None
        If lags is an integer then this is taken to be the largest lag
        that is included, the test result is reported for all smaller lag
        length. If lags is a list or array, then all lags are included up to
        the largest lag in the list, however only the tests for the lags in
        the list are reported. If lags is None, then the default maxlag is
        currently min((nobs // 2 - 2), 40). After 0.12 this will change to
        min(10, nobs // 5). The default number of lags changes if period
        is set.
    boxpierce : bool, default False
        If true, then additional to the results of the Ljung-Box test also the
        Box-Pierce test results are returned.
    model_df : int, default 0
        Number of degrees of freedom consumed by the model. In an ARMA model,
        this value is usually p+q where p is the AR order and q is the MA
        order. This value is subtracted from the degrees-of-freedom used in
        the test so that the adjusted dof for the statistics are
        lags - model_df. If lags - model_df <= 0, then NaN is returned.
    period : int, default None
        The period of a Seasonal time series.  Used to compute the max lag
        for seasonal data which uses min(2*period, nobs // 5) if set. If None,
        then the default rule is used to set the number of lags. When set, must
        be >= 2.
    return_df : bool, default None
        Flag indicating whether to return the result as a single DataFrame
        with columns lb_stat, lb_pvalue, and optionally bp_stat and bp_pvalue.
        After 0.12, this will become the only return method.  Set to True
        to return the DataFrame or False to continue returning the 2 - 4
        output. If None (the default), a warning is raised.
    auto_lag : bool, default False
        Flag indicating whether to automatically determine the optimal lag
        length based on threshold of maximum correlation value.

    Returns
    -------
    lbvalue : float or array
        The Ljung-Box test statistic.
    pvalue : float or array
        The p-value based on chi-square distribution. The p-value is computed
        as 1.0 - chi2.cdf(lbvalue, dof) where dof is lag - model_df. If
        lag - model_df <= 0, then NaN is returned for the pvalue.
    bpvalue : (optional), float or array
        The test statistic for Box-Pierce test.
    bppvalue : (optional), float or array
        The p-value based for Box-Pierce test on chi-square distribution.
        The p-value is computed as 1.0 - chi2.cdf(bpvalue, dof) where dof is
        lag - model_df. If lag - model_df <= 0, then NaN is returned for the
        pvalue.

    Homoscedasticity implies that :math:`\alpha=0`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    resid : array_like
        For the Breusch-Pagan test, this should be the residual of a
        regression. If an array is given in exog, then the residuals are
        calculated by the an OLS regression or resid on exog. In this case

    f_pvalue : float
        p-value for the f-statistic

    Notes
    -----
    Assumes x contains constant (for counting dof and calculation of R^2).
    In the general description of LM test, Greene mentions that this test
    exaggerates the significance of results in small or moderately large
    samples. In this case the F-statistic is preferable.

    **Verification**

    Chisquare test statistic is exactly (<1e-13) the same result as bptest
    in R-stats with defaults (studentize=True).

    **Implementation**

    This is calculated using the generic formula for LM test using $R^2$
    (Greene, section 17.6) and not with the explicit formula
    (Greene, section 11.4.3), unless `robust` is set to False.
    The degrees of freedom for the p-value assume x is full rank.

    Ramsey's RESET test for neglected nonlinearity

    Parameters
    ----------
    res : RegressionResults
        A results instance from a linear regression.
    power : {int, List[int]}, default 3
        The maximum power to include in the model, if an integer. Includes
        powers 2, 3, ..., power. If an list of integers, includes all powers
        in the list.
    test_type : str, default "fitted"
        The type of augmentation to use:

        * "fitted" : (default) Augment regressors with powers of fitted values.
        * "exog" : Augment exog with powers of exog. Excludes binary
          regressors.
        * "princomp": Augment exog with powers of first principal component of
          exog.
    use_f : bool, default False
        Flag indicating whether an F-test should be used (True) or a
        chi-square test (False).
    cov_type : str, default "nonrobust
        Covariance type. The default is "nonrobust` which uses the classic
        OLS covariance estimator. Specify one of "HC0", "HC1", "HC2", "HC3"
        to use White's covariance estimator. All covariance types supported
        by ``OLS.fit`` are accepted.
    cov_kwargs : dict, default None
        Dictionary of covariance options passed to ``OLS.fit``. See OLS.fit
        for more details.

    Returns
    -------
    ContrastResults
        Test results for Ramsey's Reset test. See notes for implementation
        details.

    Notes
    -----
    The RESET test uses an augmented regression of the form

    .. math::

       Y = X\beta + Z\gamma + \epsilon

    where :math:`Z` are a set of regressors that are one of:

    * Powers of :math:`X\hat{\beta}` from the original regression.
    * Powers of :math:`X`, excluding the constant and binary regressors.
    * Powers of the first principal component of :math:`X`. If the
      model includes a constant, this column is dropped before computing
      the principal component. In either case, the principal component
      is extracted from the correlation matrix of remaining columns.

    The test is a Wald test of the null :math:`H_0:\gamma=0`. If use_f
    is True, then the quadratic-form test statistic is divided by the
    number of restrictions and the F distribution is used to compute
    the critical value.

        The fraction of the data to include in the center model.
    order_by : {ndarray, str, List[str]}, default None
        If an ndarray, the values in the array are used to sort the

        data.
    use_distance : bool, default False
        Flag indicating whether data should be ordered by the Mahalanobis
        distance to the center.

    Notes
    -----
    Implements the two-moment specification test described by White's
    Theorem 2 (1980, p. 823) which compares the standard OLS covariance
    estimator with White's heteroscedasticity-consistent estimator. The
    test statistic is shown to be chi-square distributed.

    Null hypothesis is homoscedastic and correctly specified.

    Assumes the OLS design matrix contains an intercept term and at least
    one variable. The intercept is removed to calculate the test statistic.

    Interaction terms (squares and crosses of OLS regressors) are added to
    the design matrix to calculate the test statistic.

    Degrees-of-freedom (full rank) = nvar + nvar * (nvar + 1) / 2

    Linearly dependent columns are removed to avoid singular matrix error.

    Not clear: Assumption 2 in Ploberger, Kramer assumes that exog x have
    asymptotically zero mean, x.mean(0) = [1, 0, 0, ..., 0]
    Is this really necessary? I do not see how it can affect the test statistic
    under the null. It does make a difference under the alternative.
    Also, the asymptotic distribution of test statistic depends on this.

    From examples it looks like there is little power for standard cusum if
    exog (other than constant) have mean zero.
