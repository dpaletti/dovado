        Parameters
        ----------
        start_params : array_like, optional
            Initial guess of the solution for the loglikelihood maximization.
            The default is an array of zeros.
        method : str, optional
            The `method` determines which solver from `scipy.optimize`
            is used, and it can be chosen from among the following strings:

            - 'newton' for Newton-Raphson, 'nm' for Nelder-Mead
            - 'bfgs' for Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS)
            - 'lbfgs' for limited-memory BFGS with optional box constraints
            - 'powell' for modified Powell's method
            - 'cg' for conjugate gradient
            - 'ncg' for Newton-conjugate gradient
            - 'basinhopping' for global basin-hopping solver
            - 'minimize' for generic wrapper of scipy minimize (BFGS by default)

            The explicit arguments in `fit` are passed to the solver,
            with the exception of the basin-hopping solver. Each
            solver has several optional arguments that are not the same across
            solvers. See the notes section below (or scipy.optimize) for the
            available arguments and for the list of explicit arguments that the
            basin-hopping solver supports.
        maxiter : int, optional
            The maximum number of iterations to perform.
        full_output : bool, optional
            Set to True to have all available output in the Results object's
            mle_retvals attribute. The output is dependent on the solver.
            See LikelihoodModelResults notes section for more information.
        disp : bool, optional
            Set to True to print convergence messages.
        fargs : tuple, optional
            Extra arguments passed to the likelihood function, i.e.,
            loglike(x,*args)
        callback : callable callback(xk), optional
            Called after each iteration, as callback(xk), where xk is the
            current parameter vector.
        retall : bool, optional
            Set to True to return list of solutions at each iteration.
            Available in Results object's mle_retvals attribute.
        skip_hessian : bool, optional
            If False (default), then the negative inverse hessian is calculated
            after the optimization. If True, then the hessian will not be
            calculated. However, it will be available in methods that use the
            hessian in the optimization (currently only with `"newton"`).
        kwargs : keywords
            All kwargs are passed to the chosen solver with one exception. The
            following keyword controls what happens after the fit::

                warn_convergence : bool, optional
                    If True, checks the model for the converged flag. If the
                    converged flag is False, a ConvergenceWarning is issued.

        Notes
        -----
        The 'basinhopping' solver ignores `maxiter`, `retall`, `full_output`
        explicit arguments.

class GenericLikelihoodModel(LikelihoodModel):

    Allows the fitting of any likelihood function via maximum likelihood.

    A subclass needs to specify at least the log-likelihood
    If the log-likelihood is specified for each observation, then results that
    require the Jacobian will be available. (The other case is not tested yet.)

    Notes
    -----
    Optimization methods that require only a likelihood function are 'nm' and
    'powell'

    Optimization methods that require a likelihood function and a
    score/gradient are 'bfgs', 'cg', and 'ncg'. A function to compute the
    Hessian is optional for 'ncg'.

    Optimization method that require a likelihood function, a score/gradient,
    and a Hessian is 'newton'

    If they are not overwritten by a subclass, then numerical gradient,
    Jacobian and Hessian of the log-likelihood are calculated by numerical
    forward differentiation. This might results in some cases in precision
    problems, and the Hessian might not be positive definite. Even if the
    Hessian is not positive definite the covariance matrix of the parameter
    estimates based on the outer product of the Jacobian might still be valid.

        exog : array_like, optional

        transform : bool, optional
            If the model was fit via a formula, do you want to pass
            exog through the formula. Default is True. E.g., if you fit
            a model y ~ log(x1) + log(x2), and transform is True, then
            you can pass a data structure that contains x1 and x2 in

            first.
        *args
            Additional arguments to pass to the model, see the
            predict method of the model for the details.
        **kwargs
            Additional keywords arguments to pass to the model, see the

        Returns
        -------
        array_like
            See self.model.predict.

        Notes
        -----
        The types of exog that are supported depends on whether a formula
        was used in the specification of the model.

        If a formula was used, then exog is processed in the same way as
        the original data. This transformation needs to have key access to the
        same variable names, and can be a pandas DataFrame or a dict like
        object that contains numpy arrays.

        If no formula was used, then the provided exog needs to have the
        same number of columns as the original exog in the model. No
        transformation of the data is performed except converting it to
        a numpy array.

        Row indices as in pandas data frames are supported, and added to the
        returned prediction.

        This tests that the coefficient on the 2nd and 3rd regressors are
        equal and jointly that the coefficient on the 5th and 6th regressors
        are equal.

        Compute a Wald-test for a joint linear hypothesis.

        Parameters
        ----------
        r_matrix : {array_like, str, tuple}
            One of:

            - array : An r x k array where r is the number of restrictions to
              test and k is the number of regressors. It is assumed that the
              linear combination is equal to zero.
            - str : The full hypotheses to test can be given as a string.
              See the examples.
            - tuple : A tuple of arrays in the form (R, q), ``q`` can be
              either a scalar or a length p row vector.

        cov_p : array_like, optional
            An alternative estimate for the parameter covariance matrix.
            If None is given, self.normalized_cov_params is used.
        scale : float, optional
            Default is 1.0 for no scaling.

            .. deprecated:: 0.10.0

        invcov : array_like, optional
            A q x q array to specify an inverse covariance matrix based on a
            restrictions matrix.
        use_f : bool
            If True, then the F-distribution is used. If False, then the
            asymptotic distribution, chisquare is used. If use_f is None, then
            the F distribution is used if the model specifies that use_t is True.
            The test statistic is proportionally adjusted for the distribution
            by the number of constraints in the hypothesis.
        df_constraints : int, optional
            The number of constraints. If not provided the number of
            constraints is determined from r_matrix.

        Returns
        -------
        ContrastResults
            The results for the test are attributes of this results instance.

        See Also
        --------
        f_test : Perform an F tests on model parameters.
        t_test : Perform a single hypothesis test.

        The matrix `r_matrix` is assumed to be non-singular. More precisely,

        r_matrix (pX pX.T) r_matrix.T

        is assumed invertible. Here, pX is the generalized inverse of the
        design matrix of the model. There can be problems in non-OLS models
        where the rank of the covariance of the noise is not full.

        Parameters
        ----------

        Bayesian information criterion. -2*`llf` + ln(`nobs`)*p where p is the
        number of regressors including the intercept.
    bse : ndarray
        The standard errors of the coefficients.

    fitted_values : ndarray
        Linear predictor XB.
    llf : float
        Value of the loglikelihood
    llnull : float
        Value of the constant-only loglikelihood
    llr : float
        Likelihood ratio chi-squared statistic; -2*(`llnull` - `llf`)
    llr_pvalue : float
        The chi-squared probability of getting a log-likelihood ratio
