def recursive_filter(x, ar_coeff, init=...):
    """
    Autoregressive, or recursive, filtering.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Time-series data. Should be 1d or n x 1.
    ar_coeff : array_like
        AR coefficients in reverse time order. See Notes for details.
    init : array_like
        Initial values of the time-series prior to the first value of y.
        The default is zero.

    Returns
    -------
    array_like
        Filtered array, number of columns determined by x and ar_coeff. If x
        is a pandas object than a Series is returned.

    Notes
    -----
    Computes the recursive filter ::

        y[n] = ar_coeff[0] * y[n-1] + ...
                + ar_coeff[n_coeff - 1] * y[n - n_coeff] + x[n]

def convolution_filter(x, filt, nsides=...):
    """
    Linear filtering via convolution. Centered and backward displaced moving
    weighted average.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        data array, 1d or 2d, if 2d then observations in rows
    filt : array_like
        Linear filter coefficients in reverse time-order. Should have the
        same number of dimensions as x though if 1d and ``x`` is 2d will be
        coerced to 2d.
    nsides : int, optional
        If 2, a centered moving average is computed using the filter
        coefficients. If 1, the filter coefficients are for past values only.
        Both methods use scipy.signal.convolve.

    Returns
    -------
    y : ndarray, 2d
        Filtered array, number of columns determined by x and filt. If a
        pandas object is given, a pandas object is returned. The index of
        the return is the exact same as the time period in ``x``

    Notes
    -----
    In nsides == 1, x is filtered ::

        y[n] = filt[0]*x[n-1] + ... + filt[n_filt-1]*x[n-n_filt]

    where n_filt is len(filt).

    If nsides == 2, x is filtered around lag 0 ::

        y[n] = filt[0]*x[n - n_filt/2] + ... + filt[n_filt / 2] * x[n]
               + ... + x[n + n_filt/2]

    where n_filt is len(filt). If n_filt is even, then more of the filter
    is forward in time than backward.

    If filt is 1d or (nlags,1) one lag polynomial is applied to all
    variables (columns of x). If filt is 2d, (nlags, nvars) each series is
    independently filtered with its own lag polynomial, uses loop over nvar.
    This is different than the usual 2d vs 2d convolution.

    Filtering is done with scipy.signal.convolve, so it will be reasonably
    fast for medium sized data. For large data fft convolution would be
    faster.

def miso_lfilter(ar, ma, x, useic=...):
    """
    Filter multiple time series into a single time series.

    Uses a convolution to merge inputs, and then lfilter to produce output.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ar : array_like
        The coefficients of autoregressive lag polynomial including lag zero,
        ar(L) in the expression ar(L)y_t.
    ma : array_like, same ndim as x, currently 2d
        The coefficient of the moving average lag polynomial, ma(L) in
        ma(L)x_t.
    x : array_like
        The 2-d input data series, time in rows, variables in columns.
    useic : bool
        Flag indicating whether to use initial conditions.

    Returns
    -------
    y : ndarray
        The filtered output series.
    inp : ndarray, 1d
        The combined input series.

    Notes
    -----
    currently for 2d inputs only, no choice of axis
    Use of signal.lfilter requires that ar lag polynomial contains
    floating point numbers
    does not cut off invalid starting and final values

    miso_lfilter find array y such that:

            ar(L)y_t = ma(L)x_t

    with shapes y (nobs,), x (nobs, nvars), ar (narlags,), and
    ma (narlags, nvars).
