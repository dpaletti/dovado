    Parameters
    ----------
    k_endog : {array_like, int}

        number of variables in the process if an integer.
    k_states : int
        The dimension of the unobserved state process.
    k_posdef : int, optional

        Set the smoother output

        The smoother can produce several types of results. The smoother output

        Parameters
        ----------
        smoother_output : int, optional
            Bitmask value to set the smoother output to. See notes for details.
        **kwargs
            Keyword arguments may be used to influence the smoother output by
            setting individual boolean flags. See notes for details.

        Notes
        -----
        The smoother output is defined by a collection of boolean flags, and
        is internally stored as a bitmask. The methods available are:

        SMOOTHER_STATE = 0x01
            Calculate and return the smoothed states.
        SMOOTHER_STATE_COV = 0x02
            Calculate and return the smoothed state covariance matrices.
        SMOOTHER_STATE_AUTOCOV = 0x10
            Calculate and return the smoothed state lag-one autocovariance
            matrices.
        SMOOTHER_DISTURBANCE = 0x04
            Calculate and return the smoothed state and observation
            disturbances.
        SMOOTHER_DISTURBANCE_COV = 0x08
            Calculate and return the covariance matrices for the smoothed state
            and observation disturbances.
        SMOOTHER_ALL
            Calculate and return all results.

        If the bitmask is set directly via the `smoother_output` argument, then
        the full method must be provided.

        If keyword arguments are used to set individual boolean flags, then
        the lowercase of the method must be used as an argument name, and the
        value is the desired value of the boolean flag (True or False).

        Note that the smoother output may also be specified by directly
        modifying the class attributes which are defined similarly to the
        keyword arguments.

        The default smoother output is SMOOTHER_ALL.

        If performance is a concern, only those results which are needed should
        be specified as any results that are not specified will not be
        calculated. For example, if the smoother output is set to only include
        SMOOTHER_STATE, the smoother operates much more quickly than if all
        output is required.

        The smoothing method can be used to override the Kalman smoother
        approach used. By default, the Kalman smoother used depends on the
        Kalman filter method.

        Parameters
        ----------
        smooth_method : int, optional
            Bitmask value to set the filter method to. See notes for details.

        Notes
        -----
        The smoothing method is defined by a collection of boolean flags, and
        is internally stored as a bitmask. The methods available are:

        SMOOTH_CONVENTIONAL = 0x01
            Default Kalman smoother, as presented in Durbin and Koopman, 2012
            chapter 4.
        SMOOTH_CLASSICAL = 0x02
            Classical Kalman smoother, as presented in Anderson and Moore, 1979
            or Durbin and Koopman, 2012 chapter 4.6.1.
        SMOOTH_ALTERNATIVE = 0x04
            Modified Bryson-Frazier Kalman smoother method; this is identical
            to the conventional method of Durbin and Koopman, 2012, except that
            an additional intermediate step is included.
        SMOOTH_UNIVARIATE = 0x08
            Univariate Kalman smoother, as presented in Durbin and Koopman,
            2012 chapter 6, except with modified Bryson-Frazier timing.

        Practically speaking, these methods should all produce the same output
        but different computational implications, numerical stability
        implications, or internal timing assumptions.

        Note that only the first method is available if using a Scipy version
        older than 0.16.

        If the bitmask is set directly via the `smooth_method` argument, then
        the full method must be provided.

        If keyword arguments are used to set individual boolean flags, then
        the lowercase of the method must be used as an argument name, and the
        value is the desired value of the boolean flag (True or False).

        Note that the filter method may also be specified by directly modifying
        the class attributes which are defined similarly to the keyword
        arguments.

        The default filtering method is SMOOTH_CONVENTIONAL.

        ----------
        lag : int, optional
            The number of period to shift when computing the autocovariance.
            Default is 1.

            See the Returns section for details on how this parameter affects

        end : int, optional
            The end of the interval (exclusive) autocovariances to compute and
            return. Note that since it is an exclusive endpoint, the returned
            autocovariances do not include the value at this index. Cannot be

            for details on how this parameter affects what is what is returned
            and what the default value is.
        extend_kwargs : dict, optional
            Keyword arguments containing updated state space system matrices
            for handling out-of-sample autocovariance computations in
            time-varying state space models.

        Returns
        -------
        acov : ndarray
            Array of autocovariance matrices. If the argument `t` is not
            provided, then it is shaped `(k_states, k_states, n)`, while if `t`
            given then the third axis is dropped and the array is shaped
            `(k_states, k_states)`.

            The output under the default case differs somewhat based on the
            state space model and the sign of the lag. To see how these cases
            differ, denote the output at each time point as Cov(t, t-j). Then:

            - If `lag > 0` (and the model is either time-varying or
              time-invariant), then the returned array is shaped `(*, *, nobs)`
              and each entry [:, :, t] contains Cov(t, t-j). However, the model
              does not have enough information to compute autocovariances in
              the pre-sample period, so that we cannot compute Cov(1, 1-lag),
              Cov(2, 2-lag), ..., Cov(lag, 0). Thus the first `lag` entries
              have all values set to NaN.

            - If the model is time-invariant and `lag < -1` or if `lag` is
              0 or -1, and the model is either time-invariant or time-varying,
              then the returned array is shaped `(*, *, nobs)` and each
              entry [:, :, t] contains Cov(t, t+j). Moreover, all entries are
              available (i.e. there are no NaNs).

            - If the model is time-varying and `lag < -1` and `extend_kwargs`
              is not provided, then the returned array is shaped
              `(*, *, nobs - lag + 1)`.

            - However, if the model is time-varying and `lag < -1`, then
              `extend_kwargs` can be provided with `lag - 1` additional
              matrices so that the returned array is shaped `(*, *, nobs)` as
              usual.

            More generally, the dimension of the last axis will be
            `start - end`.

        Notes
        -----
        This method computes:

        .. math::

            Cov(\alpha_t - \hat \alpha_t, \alpha_{t - j} - \hat \alpha_{t - j})

        where the `lag` argument determines the autocovariance order :math:`j`,
        and `lag` is an integer (positive, zero, or negative). This method
        cannot compute values associated with time points prior to the sample,
        and so it returns a matrix of NaN values for these time points.
        For example, if `start=0` and `lag=2`, then assuming the output is
        assigned to the variable `acov`, we will have `acov[..., 0]` and
        `acov[..., 1]` as matrices filled with NaN values.

        Based only on the "current" results object (i.e. the Kalman smoother
        applied to the sample), there is not enough information to compute
        Cov(t, t+j) for the last `lag - 1` observations of the sample. However,
        the values can be computed for these time points using the transition
        equation of the state space representation, and so for time-invariant
        state space models we do compute these values. For time-varying models,
        this can also be done, but updated state space matrices for the
        out-of-sample time points must be provided via the `extend_kwargs`
        argument.

        See [1]_, Chapter 4.7, for all details about how these autocovariances
        are computed.

        The `t` and `start`/`end` parameters compute and return only the
        requested autocovariances. As a result, using these parameters is
        recommended to reduce the computational burden, particularly if the
        number of observations and/or the dimension of the state vector is
        large.

        Compute the news and impacts associated with a data release

        Parameters
        ----------
        previous : SmootherResults
            Prior results object relative to which to compute the news. This
            results object must have identical state space representation for
            the prior sample period so that the only difference is that this
            results object has updates to the observed data.
        t : int, optional
            A specific period for which to compute the news. Cannot be used in
            combination with `start` or `end`.
        start : int, optional
            The start of the interval (inclusive) of news to compute. Cannot be
            used in combination with the `t` argument. Default is the last
            period of the sample (`nobs - 1`).
        end : int, optional
            The end of the interval (exclusive) of news to compute. Note that
            since it is an exclusive endpoint, the returned news do not include
            the value at this index. Cannot be used in combination with the `t`
            argument.
        design : array, optional
            Design matrix for the period `t` in time-varying models. If this
            model has a time-varying design matrix, and the argument `t` is out
            of this model's sample, then a new design matrix for period `t`
            must be provided. Unused otherwise.

        Returns
        -------
        news_results : SimpleNamespace
            News and impacts associated with a data release. Includes the
            following attributes:

            - `update_impacts`: update to forecasts of impacted variables from
              the news. It is equivalent to E[y^i | post] - E[y^i | revision],
              where y^i are the variables of interest. In [1]_, this is
              described as "revision" in equation (17).
            - `revision_impacts`: update to forecasts of variables impacted
              variables from data revisions. It is
              E[y^i | revision] - E[y^i | previous], and does not have a
              specific notation in [1]_, since there for simplicity they assume
              that there are no revisions.
            - `news`: the unexpected component of the updated data. Denoted
              I = y^u - E[y^u | previous], where y^u are the data points that
              were newly incorporated in a data release (but not including
              revisions to data points that already existed in the previous
              release). In [1]_, this is described as "news" in equation (17).
            - `gain`: the gain matrix associated with the "Kalman-like" update
              from the news, E[y I'] E[I I']^{-1}. In [1]_, this can be found
              in the equation For E[y_{k,t_k} \mid I_{v+1}] in the middle of
              page 17.
            - `update_forecasts`: forecasts of the updated periods used to
              construct the news, E[y^u | previous].
            - `update_realized`: realizations of the updated periods used to
              construct the news, y^u.
            - `prev_impacted_forecasts`: previous forecast of the periods of
              interest, E[y^i | previous].
            - `post_impacted_forecasts`: forecast of the periods of interest
              after taking into account both revisions and updates,
              E[y^i | post].
            - `revision_results`: results object that updates the `previous`
              results to take into account data revisions.
            - `revisions_ix`: list of `(t, i)` positions of revisions in endog
            - `updates_ix`: list of `(t, i)` positions of updates to endog

        Notes
        -----
        This method computes the effect of new data (e.g. from a new data
        release) on smoothed forecasts produced by a state space model, as
        described in [1]_.
