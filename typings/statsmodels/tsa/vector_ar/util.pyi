    """
    Simulate VAR(p) process, given coefficients and assuming Gaussian noise

    Parameters
    ----------
    coefs : ndarray
        Coefficients for the VAR lags of endog.
    intercept : None or ndarray 1-D (neqs,) or (steps, neqs)
        This can be either the intercept for each equation or an offset.
        If None, then the VAR process has a zero intercept.
        If intercept is 1-D, then the same (endog specific) intercept is added
        to all observations.
        If intercept is 2-D, then it is treated as an offset and is added as
        an observation specific intercept to the autoregression. In this case,
        the intercept/offset should have same number of rows as steps, and the
        same number of columns as endogenous variables (neqs).
    sig_u : ndarray
        Covariance matrix of the residuals or innovations.
        If sig_u is None, then an identity matrix is used.
    steps : {None, int}
        number of observations to simulate, this includes the initial
        observations to start the autoregressive process.
        If offset is not None, then exog of the model are used if they were
        provided in the model
    seed : {None, int}
        If seed is not None, then it will be used with for the random
        variables generated by numpy.random.

def seasonal_dummies(n_seasons, len_endog, first_period=..., centered=...):
    """

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_seasons : int >= 0
        Number of seasons (e.g. 12 for monthly data and 4 for quarterly data).
    len_endog : int >= 0
        Total number of observations.
    first_period : int, default: 0
        Season of the first observation. As an example, suppose we have monthly
        data and the first observation is in March (third month of the year).
        In this case we pass 2 as first_period. (0 for the first season,
        1 for the second, ..., n_seasons-1 for the last season).
        An integer greater than n_seasons-1 are treated in the same way as the
        integer modulo n_seasons.
    centered : bool, default: False
        If True, center (demean) the dummy variables. That is useful in order
        to get seasonal dummies that are orthogonal to the vector of constant
        dummy variables (a vector of ones).

    -------
