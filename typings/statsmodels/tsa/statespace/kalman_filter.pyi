    State space representation of a time series process, with Kalman filter

    Parameters
    ----------
    k_endog : {array_like, int}
        The observed time-series process :math:`y` if array like or the

    k_states : int
        The dimension of the unobserved state process.
    k_posdef : int, optional
        The dimension of a guaranteed positive definite covariance matrix
        describing the shocks in the transition equation. Must be less than
        or equal to `k_states`. Default is `k_states`.
    loglikelihood_burn : int, optional

        recorded. Default is 0.
    tolerance : float, optional

        steady-state. Default is 1e-19.
    results_class : class, optional
        Default results class to use to save filtering output. Default is
        `FilterResults`. If specified, class must extend from `FilterResults`.
    **kwargs
        Keyword arguments may be used to provide values for the filter,
        inversion, and stability methods. See `set_filter_method`,
        `set_inversion_method`, and `set_stability_method`.
        Keyword arguments may be used to provide default values for state space
        matrices. See `Representation` for more details.

    Notes
    -----
    There are several types of options available for controlling the Kalman
    filter operation. All options are internally held as bitmasks, but can be
    manipulated by setting class attributes, which act like boolean flags. For
    more information, see the `set_*` class method documentation. The options
    are:

    filter_method
        The filtering method controls aspects of which
        Kalman filtering approach will be used.
    inversion_method
        The Kalman filter may contain one matrix inversion: that of the
        forecast error covariance matrix. The inversion method controls how and
        if that inverse is performed.
    stability_method
        The Kalman filter is a recursive algorithm that may in some cases
        suffer issues with numerical stability. The stability method controls
        what, if any, measures are taken to promote stability.
    conserve_memory
        By default, the Kalman filter computes a number of intermediate
        matrices at each iteration. The memory conservation options control
        which of those matrices are stored.
    filter_timing
        By default, the Kalman filter follows Durbin and Koopman, 2012, in
        initializing the filter with predicted values. Kim and Nelson, 1999,
        instead initialize the filter with filtered values, which is
        essentially just a different timing convention.

    The `filter_method` and `inversion_method` options intentionally allow
    the possibility that multiple methods will be indicated. In the case that
    multiple methods are selected, the underlying Kalman filter will attempt to
    select the optional method given the input data.

    For example, it may be that INVERT_UNIVARIATE and SOLVE_CHOLESKY are
    indicated (this is in fact the default case). In this case, if the
    endogenous vector is 1-dimensional (`k_endog` = 1), then INVERT_UNIVARIATE
    is used and inversion reduces to simple division, and if it has a larger
    dimension, the Cholesky decomposition along with linear solving (rather
    than explicit matrix inversion) is used. If only SOLVE_CHOLESKY had been
    set, then the Cholesky decomposition method would *always* be used, even in
    the case of 1-dimensional data.

        Set the filtering method

        The filtering method controls aspects of which Kalman filtering
        approach will be used.

        Parameters
        ----------
        filter_method : int, optional
            Bitmask value to set the filter method to. See notes for details.
        **kwargs
            Keyword arguments may be used to influence the filter method by
            setting individual boolean flags. See notes for details.

        Notes
        -----
        The filtering method is defined by a collection of boolean flags, and
        is internally stored as a bitmask. The methods available are:

        FILTER_CONVENTIONAL
            Conventional Kalman filter.
        FILTER_UNIVARIATE
            Univariate approach to Kalman filtering. Overrides conventional
            method if both are specified.
        FILTER_COLLAPSED
            Collapsed approach to Kalman filtering. Will be used *in addition*
            to conventional or univariate filtering.
        FILTER_CONCENTRATED
            Use the concentrated log-likelihood function. Will be used
            *in addition* to the other options.

        Note that only the first method is available if using a Scipy version
        older than 0.16.

        If the bitmask is set directly via the `filter_method` argument, then
        the full method must be provided.

        If keyword arguments are used to set individual boolean flags, then
        the lowercase of the method must be used as an argument name, and the
        value is the desired value of the boolean flag (True or False).

        Note that the filter method may also be specified by directly modifying
        the class attributes which are defined similarly to the keyword
        arguments.

        The default filtering method is FILTER_CONVENTIONAL.

        Notes

        The inversion method is defined by a collection of boolean flags, and
        is internally stored as a bitmask. The methods available are:

        INVERT_UNIVARIATE
            If the endogenous time series is univariate, then inversion can be
            performed by simple division. If this flag is set and the time
            series is univariate, then division will always be used even if
            other flags are also set.
        SOLVE_LU
            Use an LU decomposition along with a linear solver (rather than
            ever actually inverting the matrix).
        INVERT_LU
            Use an LU decomposition along with typical matrix inversion.
        SOLVE_CHOLESKY
            Use a Cholesky decomposition along with a linear solver.
        INVERT_CHOLESKY
            Use an Cholesky decomposition along with typical matrix inversion.

        If the bitmask is set directly via the `inversion_method` argument,
        then the full method must be provided.

        If keyword arguments are used to set individual boolean flags, then
        the lowercase of the method must be used as an argument name, and the
        value is the desired value of the boolean flag (True or False).

        Note that the inversion method may also be specified by directly
        modifying the class attributes which are defined similarly to the
        keyword arguments.

        The default inversion method is `INVERT_UNIVARIATE | SOLVE_CHOLESKY`

        Several things to keep in mind are:

        - If the filtering method is specified to be univariate, then simple
          division is always used regardless of the dimension of the endogenous
          time series.
        - Cholesky decomposition is about twice as fast as LU decomposition,
          but it requires that the matrix be positive definite. While this
          should generally be true, it may not be in every case.
        - Using a linear solver rather than true matrix inversion is generally
          faster and is numerically more stable.

        --------
        >>> mod = sm.tsa.statespace.SARIMAX(range(10))

        impulse : int or array_like
            If an integer, the state innovation to pulse; must be between 0
            and `k_posdef-1` where `k_posdef` is the same as in the state

        counter-intuitively - returning the impulse response within the given

        doing impulse responses after the end of the model. To compute impulse
