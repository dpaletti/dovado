The RegressionFDR class implements the 'Knockoff' approach for
controlling false discovery rates (FDR) in regression analysis.

The knockoff approach does not require standard errors.  Thus one
application is to provide inference for parameter estimates that are
not smooth functions of the data.  For example, the knockoff approach
can be used to do inference for parameter estimates obtained from the
LASSO, of from stepwise variable selection.

The knockoff approach controls FDR for parameter estimates that may be
dependent, such as coefficient estimates in a multiple regression
model.

The knockoff approach is applicable whenever the test statistic can be
computed entirely from x'y and x'x, where x is the design matrix and y
is the vector of responses.

class RegressionFDR(object):
    """
    Control FDR in a regression procedure.

    Parameters
    ----------
    endog : array_like
        The dependent variable of the regression
    exog : array_like
        The independent variables of the regression
    regeffects : RegressionEffects instance
        An instance of a RegressionEffects class that can compute
        effect sizes for the regression coefficients.
    method : str
        The approach used to assess and control FDR, currently
        must be 'knockoff'.

    Returns
    -------
    Returns an instance of the RegressionFDR class.  The `fdr` attribute
    holds the estimated false discovery rates.

    Notes
    -----
    This class Implements the knockoff method of Barber and Candes.
    This is an approach for controlling the FDR of a variety of
    regression estimation procedures, including correlation
    coefficients, OLS regression, OLS with forward selection, and
    LASSO regression.

    For other approaches to FDR control in regression, see the
    statsmodels.stats.multitest module.  Methods provided in that
    module use Z-scores or p-values, and therefore require standard
    errors for the coefficient estimates to be available.

    The default method for constructing the augmented design matrix is
    the 'equivariant' approach, set `design_method='sdp'` to use an
    alternative approach involving semidefinite programming.  See
    Barber and Candes for more information about both approaches.  The
    sdp approach requires that the cvxopt package be installed.
