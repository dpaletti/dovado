"""
A collection of smooth penalty functions.

Penalties on vectors take a vector argument and return a scalar
penalty.  The gradient of the penalty is a vector with the same shape
as the input value.

Penalties on covariance matrices take two arguments: the matrix and
its inverse, both in unpacked (square) form.  The returned penalty is
a scalar, and the gradient is returned as a vector that contains the
gradient with respect to the free elements in the lower triangle of
the covariance matrix.

All penalties are subtracted from the log-likelihood, so greater
penalty values correspond to a greater degree of penalization.

The penaties should be smooth so that they can be subtracted from log
likelihood functions and optimized using standard methods (i.e. L1
penalties do not belong here).

class Penalty(object):

    Parameters
    ----------

    Notes
    -----

class SCAD(Penalty):
    """
    The SCAD penalty of Fan and Li.

    The SCAD penalty is linear around zero as a L1 penalty up to threshold tau.
    The SCAD penalty is constant for values larger than c*tau.
    The middle segment is quadratic and connect the two segments with a continuous
    derivative.
    The penalty is symmetric around zero.

    Parameterization follows Boo, Johnson, Li and Tan 2011.
    Fan and Li use lambda instead of tau, and a instead of c. Fan and Li
    recommend setting c=3.7.

    f(x) = { tau |x|                                        if 0 <= |x| < tau
           { -(|x|^2 - 2 c tau |x| + tau^2) / (2 (c - 1))   if tau <= |x| < c tau
           { (c + 1) tau^2 / 2                              if c tau <= |x|

    Parameters
    ----------
    tau : float
        slope and threshold for linear segment
    c : float
        factor for second threshold which is c * tau
    weights : None or array
        weights for penalty of each parameter. If an entry is zero, then the
        corresponding parameter will not be penalized.

    Parameters
    ----------
    penalty: instance of penalty function

        penalty class
    weights : None or ndarray
        weights for adding penalties of transformed params
