        The objective for the minimization can be results attributes like

        Warning: In many case the optimization might converge to a local
        optimum or near optimum. Different start_params or using a global
        optimizer is recommended, default is basinhopping.

        Parameters
        ----------
        criterion='aic'
            name of results attribute to be minimized.
            Default is 'aic', other options are 'gcv', 'cv' or 'bic'.
        start_params : None or array
            starting parameters for alpha in the penalization weight
            minimization. The parameters are internally exponentiated and

            starting parameter for the ``model._fit_pirls``.
        method : 'basinhopping', 'nm' or 'minimize'
            'basinhopping' and 'nm' directly use the underlying scipy.optimize
            functions `basinhopping` and `fmin`. 'minimize' provides access
            to the high level interface, `scipy.optimize.minimize`.
        fit_kwds : keyword arguments
            additional keyword arguments will be used in the call to the
            scipy optimizer. Which keywords are supported depends on the
            scipy optimization function.

        Returns
        -------
        alpha : ndarray
            penalization parameter found by minimizing the criterion.
            Note that this can be only a local (near) optimum.
        fit_res : tuple
            results returned by the scipy optimization routine. The
            parameters in the optimization problem are `log(alpha)`
        history : dict
            history of calls to pirls and contains alpha, the fit
            criterion and the parameters to which pirls converged to for the
            given alpha.

        Notes
        -----
        In the test cases Nelder-Mead and bfgs often converge to local optima,
        see also https://github.com/statsmodels/statsmodels/issues/5381.

        This does not use any analytical derivatives for the criterion
        minimization.

        Status: experimental, It is possible that defaults change if there
        is a better way to find a global optimum. API (e.g. type of return)
        might also change.
