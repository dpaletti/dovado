"""Tools for working with groups

This provides several functions to work with groups and a Group class that
keeps track of the different representations and has methods to work more
easily with groups.

Created on Tue Nov 29 15:44:53 2011 : sparse_dummies
Created on Wed Nov 30 14:28:24 2011 : combine_indices
changes: add Group class

Notes
~~~~~

This reverses the class I used before, where the class was for the data and
the group was auxiliary. Here, it is only the group, no data is kept.

sparse_dummies needs checking for corner cases, e.g.
what if a category level has zero elements? This can happen with subset
    selection even if the original groups where defined as arange.

Not all methods and options have been tried out yet after refactoring

need more efficient loop if groups are sorted -> see GroupSorted.group_iter

    Parameters
    ----------
    groups : ndarray, int, 1d (nobs,)
        an array of group indicators for each observation. Group levels are
        assumed to be defined as consecutive integers, i.e. range(n_groups)
        where n_groups is the number of group levels. A group level with no
        observations for it will still produce a column of zeros.

    -------
    indi : ndarray, int8, 2d (nobs, n_groups)
        an indicator array with one row per observation, that has 1 in the
        column of the group level for that observation

    --------

    >>> g = np.array([0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0])
