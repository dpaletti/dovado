SPSS manual
SAS manual

This follows in large parts the SPSS manual, which is largely the same as
the SAS manual with different, simpler notation.

Freq, Weight in SAS seems redundant since they always show up as product, SPSS
has only weights.

Notes
-----

This has potential problems with ddof, I started to follow numpy with ddof=0
by default and users can change it, but this might still mess up the t-tests,
since the estimates for the standard deviation will be based on the ddof that
the user chooses.
- fixed ddof for the meandiff ttest, now matches scipy.stats.ttest_ind

Note: scipy has now a separate, pooled variance option in ttest, but I have not
compared yet.

class DescrStatsW(object):
    """
    Descriptive statistics and tests with weights for case weights

    Assumes that the data is 1d or 2d with (nobs, nvars) observations in rows,
    variables in columns, and that the same weight applies to each column.

    If degrees of freedom correction is used, then weights should add up to the
    number of observations. ttest also assumes that the sum of weights
    corresponds to the sample size.

    This is essentially the same as replicating each observations by its
    weight, if the weights are integers, often called case or frequency weights.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : array_like, 1-D or 2-D
        dataset
    weights : None or 1-D ndarray
        weights for each observation, with same length as zero axis of data
    ddof : int
        default ddof=0, degrees of freedom correction used for second moments,
        var, std, cov, corrcoef.
        However, statistical tests are independent of `ddof`, based on the
        standard formulas.

    Examples
    --------

    >>> np.random.seed(0)
    >>> x1_2d = 1.0 + np.random.randn(20, 3)

        Notes

        To compute the quantiles, first, the weights are summed over
        exact ties yielding distinct data values y_1 < y_2 < ..., and
        corresponding weights w_1, w_2, ....  Let s_j denote the sum
        of the first j weights, and let W denote the sum of all the
        weights.  For a probability point p, if pW falls strictly
        between s_j and s_{j+1} then the estimated quantile is
        y_{j+1}.  If pW = s_j then the estimated quantile is (y_j +
        y_{j+1})/2.  If pW < p_1 then the estimated quantile is y_1.

        We can replicate the results from ``proportions_ztest`` if we increase
        the weights to have artificially one more observation:
