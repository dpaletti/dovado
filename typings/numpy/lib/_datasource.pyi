"""A file interface for handling local and remote data files.

The goal of datasource is to abstract some of the file system operations
when dealing with data files so the researcher doesn't have to know all the
low-level details.  Through datasource, a researcher can obtain and use a
file with one function call, regardless of location of the file.

DataSource is meant to augment standard python libraries, not replace them.
It should work seamlessly with standard file IO operations and the os
module.

DataSource files can originate locally or remotely:

- local files : '/home/guido/src/local/data.txt'
- URLs (http, ftp, ...) : 'http://www.scipy.org/not/real/data.txt'

DataSource files can also be compressed or uncompressed.  Currently only
gzip, bz2 and xz are supported.

Example::

    >>> # Create a DataSource, use os.curdir (default) for local storage.
    >>> from numpy import DataSource
    >>> ds = DataSource()
    >>>
    >>> # Open a remote file.
    >>> # DataSource downloads the file, stores it locally in:
    >>> #     './www.google.com/index.html'
    >>> # opens the file and returns a file object.
    >>> fp = ds.open('http://www.google.com/') # doctest: +SKIP
    >>>
    >>> # Use the file as you normally would
    >>> fp.read() # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> fp.close() # doctest: +SKIP

"""
_open = open
class _FileOpeners:
    """
    Container for different methods to open (un-)compressed files.

    `_FileOpeners` contains a dictionary that holds one method for each
    supported file format. Attribute lookup is implemented in such a way
    that an instance of `_FileOpeners` itself can be indexed with the keys
    of that dictionary. Currently uncompressed files as well as files
    compressed with ``gzip``, ``bz2`` or ``xz`` compression are supported.

    Notes
    -----
    `_file_openers`, an instance of `_FileOpeners`, is made available for
    use in the `_datasource` module.

    --------
    >>> import gzip

    [None, '.bz2', '.gz', '.xz', '.lzma']
    >>> np.lib._datasource._file_openers['.gz'] is gzip.open

    Open `path` with `mode` and return the file object.

    If ``path`` is an URL, it will be downloaded, stored in the
    `DataSource` `destpath` directory and opened from there.

    Parameters
    ----------
    path : str
        Local file path or URL to open.
    mode : str, optional
        Mode to open `path`. Mode 'r' for reading, 'w' for writing, 'a' to
        append. Available modes depend on the type of object specified by
        path.  Default is 'r'.
    destpath : str, optional
        Path to the directory where the source file gets downloaded to for
        use.  If `destpath` is None, a temporary directory will be created.
        The default path is the current directory.

class DataSource:

    DataSource(destpath='.')

    A generic data source file (file, http, ftp, ...).

    DataSources can be local files or remote files/URLs.  The files may
    also be compressed or uncompressed. DataSource hides some of the
    low-level details of downloading the file, allowing you to simply pass
    in a valid file path (or URL) and obtain a file object.

    Parameters
    ----------
    destpath : str or None, optional
        Path to the directory where the source file gets downloaded to for
        use.  If `destpath` is None, a temporary directory will be created.
        The default path is the current directory.

    Notes
    -----
    URLs require a scheme string (``http://``) to be used, without it they
    will fail::

        >>> repos = np.DataSource()
        >>> repos.exists('www.google.com/index.html')
        False
        >>> repos.exists('http://www.google.com/index.html')
        True

    Temporary directories are deleted when the DataSource is deleted.

    Examples
    --------
    ::

        >>> ds = np.DataSource('/home/guido')
        >>> urlname = 'http://www.google.com/'

    Repository(baseurl, destpath='.')

    A data repository where multiple DataSource's share a base

    `Repository` extends `DataSource` by prepending a base URL (or
    directory) to all the files it handles. Use `Repository` when you will
    be working with multiple files from one base URL.  Initialize
    `Repository` with the base URL, then refer to each file by its filename
    only.

    ----------
    baseurl : str
        Path to the local directory or remote location that contains the
        data files.
    destpath : str or None, optional
        Path to the directory where the source file gets downloaded to for
